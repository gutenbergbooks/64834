<p id="Ref_1" class="center xxlargefont nobreak" style="margin-bottom:1em">THE ORIGIN OF THOUGHT
AND SPEECH</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>When opening my eyes in the morning, and whilst still
struggling with an inclination to sleep, I review the day
and what it will have in store for me; but the pictures
drawn are confused, and my will takes no part in it.</p>

<p>For some time I have been haunted by the impression
that the mental faculties of the generality of men have
not succeeded in throwing off a species of torpor resembling
that of a person hardly awake; the supposition that
this torpid condition prevents our minds from attaining
that degree of lucidity to which they have a right to
aspire, is perhaps a hallucination, yet possibly I may be
right in thinking it.</p>

<p>How many confused ideas traverse my brain in one
day, and how seldom those come of which I follow the
thread. We know well that injunction so often given by
parents to children, and by schoolmasters to their pupils:
“Try to concentrate your attention.” It almost seems
as if that which we require of children is beyond my
powers, for I have hardly resolved to disentangle a problem
of whatever kind, when, under the form of useless,
futile, inept thoughts, obstacles heap themselves across
my path. I conclude from this that a fatal somnolence
paralyses my faculties.</p>

<p>When a person has to be awakened who is disinclined<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
to be disturbed, he is violently shaken. What movement
would suffice to energise a man whose mental powers were
drowsy? I do not see anything from the outside; and a
personal effort could not be looked for, from an enervated
will.</p>

<p>And yet I am possessed by the desire to penetrate the
mystery of my existence; I ask myself what I am, and
why I am on this earth; from the moment that I put
this question to myself I feel that the awakening may be
possible for me. I know two classes of men who never
ask it; first those who do not see that there is any
problem to solve; and secondly those who are content
with infantine and superficial teaching; or more or less
elaborate and learned, but coming from one who appears to
himself to be the depository of a collection of supernaturally
inspired truths. I own that I do not belong to
the first of these divisions, since I shall have no rest as
long as I am ignorant of what passes in me and around
me; neither do I belong to the second of these classes,
since those who compose it are content to believe; but
faith is not knowledge, and I am anxious to comprehend
what has been discovered, known, and established by
evidence. But how shall I submit to this labour of
research, when the habitual condition of my thoughts is
to wander at will amongst my impressions, and when I
am so incurably absent-minded?</p>

<p>We live in an atmosphere of many and varied ideas;
ideas true and false, good and bad; they pulsate in the
air we breathe; they are like the winged antheral seeds
which are lifted up by the slightest breeze of autumn
and carried afar; they are little heeded; but should it
happen that these seeds attached themselves to our garments
we should notice how strikingly the one form varied
from the other.</p>

<p>Amongst those ideas which wander at large is this
aphorism&mdash;that we are ignorant of that of which we know<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
not the commencement, or in other words of that which
we do not examine from the practical point of view; he
who wishes to learn how something is made, whatever it
may be, must know how to begin it. This truth has so
ancient a date that we cannot conceive of a time when it
was absent from the mind of man; only it had the
common lot of all truths with which we are so familiar
that apparently there is nothing to learn from them, and
this aphorism appears at first sight to be the ramblings
which we hear but to which we do not listen.</p>

<p>To me it is of value, as it strengthens my conviction
that the mist which obscures my vision will not be dissipated
until I have traced certain problems to their
source; I know by experience that few phenomena are
easy of explanation when their appearances only are examined
at any given moment; and close questioning fails
to elicit light, whilst ignorance prevails concerning their
beginning.</p>

<p>How does it happen that in spite of such unfavourable
circumstances, often with no clear purpose, and with eyes
half shut, humanity can advance? For the progress is
indubitable. The public conscience has developed; and
its actions make themselves felt; civilised nations have
become more humane; they understand better than they
did formerly that peace is more profitable than war;
certain social problems are being seriously discussed, and
some are on the point of solution. In the physical
sciences, as well as in mechanical arts, progress is most
marked. But I see that though imagination, observation,
and a talent for invention have had much to do with this
progress, the capacity of imitation has also been a powerful
factor. When William Herschel gave up music for
astronomy, he perfected the optical instruments which
were in use at that time, and manufactured some excellent
telescopes at comparatively moderate prices, with the
result that his fellow astronomers and their successors<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
were able to devote themselves to the study of the
heavens with greater ease and readiness; and the discovery
of Uranus was soon followed by that of a large
number of celestial bodies. Again, at one of the National
Exhibitions of our time, there was shown to all comers
the model of a recently invented apparatus for the conveyance
of the wounded on battlefields; since which, each
country now produces its own design with various improvements,
and the victims of the barbarism, still lingering
in war, were benefited by these modern appliances,
due entirely to the art of imitation.</p>

<p>In short, progress exists, but not all along the line. As
thought travels slowly in its own domain, so mental science
is behindhand. A true idea is not mechanically reproduced,
it must be tended for it to bear fruit, but what
tendance would avail, if it is only with difficulty that we
discriminate between what we know already, and what we
do not yet know, for this distinction must accompany
conscious progress.</p>

<p>Everything around us tends to keep us in this
penumbra, which is so favourable to inertia, ignorance,
sleep. Certain groups of philosophical ideas become
condensed and systematised; in some systems there are
one or two great thoughts only. This suffices&mdash;these
systems remain, germinate and direct contemporaneous
generations as well as those of the future. It may also
happen that these same ideas invade brains little prepared
to receive them, and thus deviate from their course, err as
they advance, and end by becoming so travestied that it
is no longer possible to know what they were at their
origin&mdash;a swerving movement has taken place, which
causes suffering to contemporaries, and, still more, to those
who come after. Thus the bulk increases, the bulk of
truth and the bulk of error; and this fatal expansion of
the true and the false, intertwined the one with the other,
pursues its encroaching and troublous way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>This confusion is something impersonal; it is an opaque
body which interposes itself between the truth and ourselves,
and prevents us from contemplating it; but the
confusion may also arise directly from those whose mission
it is to guide us. I open a book written by some grave
thinker who, I imagine, knows his subject thoroughly, and
I begin to read in all confidence; at first I think I
understand him; then I am stopped by a word, and I
wonder what meaning the author has attached to it; a
little further I come upon the same word, which now
seems invested with another signification; this disconcerts
me, and I close the book. I take another, but the same
disagreeable surprise awaits me, and I find everywhere
terms whose meaning varies to suit the convenience of the
author; and what we are to understand by these words
is nowhere explained. These defects arise probably from
the fact that certain philosophers, taking their confused
opinions for new ideas, seek for words in which to express
them, and not finding them in their vocabulary, they coin
them, using terms to which no precise meaning is attached;
which terms remain more or less enigmatical to the authors
themselves, and, consequently, unintelligible to the readers;
in this way does the confusion of ideas arise and is propagated.
A philosopher, I think it was Haman, made
the following very true and very alarming statement:
“Language is not only the basis of our power of thought,
but also the point from which our misunderstandings and
errors spring”; and Hobbes also says: “It is obvious that
truth and falsehood dwell only with those living creatures
who have the use of speech.”</p>

<p>But all that I have just said indicates merely a superficial
portion of my passing impressions; in going below
the surface I find in the past other causes for our present
perturbation of mind. For centuries we have frequented
schools in order to learn to distinguish truth from error,
yet it is always a mixture of truth and error that we are<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
taught. What result had we attained on the eve of the
twentieth century? We are still asking ourselves whether
science does or does not harmonise with religion. After
that we cannot but give ourselves up to the deepest
despondency, we cannot but fold our arms in despair and
question whether we shall ever see things clearly.</p>

<p>Amongst our ancestors there were sometimes found men
of great resolution who, in order to punish themselves for
cowardice and luxury, administered discipline to themselves;
the idea is not so extravagant as it appears to
some people. A few good strokes of the whip might
result in reviving or strengthening the will, and in forcing
it to resist the moral supineness which is so apt to increase;
but physical discipline is no longer in use amongst us,
and in my own case I have substituted an illustration of
which I try never to lose sight. I picture to myself an
ideal potter, whose whole ambition would be to make
good vessels, and, having succeeded in making some of
great solidity, he would choose out those of the finest
shape for the market. He attains success, and his
thoughts being occupied with his pottery only, at last he
makes vases of absolute perfection. With what feelings
of envy I contemplate this creature of my imagination,
who is to serve as my model, and yet whom the want of
concentration of thought prevents me from imitating.</p>

<p>It would have been perhaps prudent on my part to
follow the example of this workman, and to accustom
myself to reflect on subjects less immeasurably above me
than those which have such a powerful attraction for me;
but I yield to the impulse&mdash;once given. I often lose myself
when pondering on the world where destiny has placed
me; and I ask myself&mdash;How did life first appear on the
earth? Was there nothing but a cellule from whence all
that fills space came? Was there one cellule for the
vegetables and another for the animals? If man did not
spring from the cradle of all things that live and grow on<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
the surface of the globe, was he an individual of his own
species at the beginning, or two individuals, or many?
After what fashion did man speak at his first appearance?
What were his thoughts? “How can it be explained,” I
asked myself again, “that of all the members of the animal
kingdom, one only should have marvelled at and pondered
on his position with regard to the universe and himself?
That one only should have manifested the desire to understand
his role in life, whilst all the creatures that surrounded
him, lived contentedly in blissful ignorance? It would be
impossible to conceive of a horse, an elephant, or a mammoth
disquieting itself concerning its origin and the end
of its being; why has man only sought a solution of these
problems?” The learned scholars who occupy themselves
with these questions are far from agreeing unanimously
concerning them; thus I&mdash;I, who am only one link in the
interminable chain of units which composes humanity,
past, present and future; I, in my own individuality
must live and die in my ignorance. I revolt against this
prospect, which I yet recognise as inevitable; I refuse to
acknowledge myself beaten, and I feel myself irresistibly
driven to seek for more knowledge; then feeling unable
to supply the lack, I cease to be anxious, and fall asleep
again.</p>

<p>Sometimes when led to investigate the inner tribunal,
conscience, I contemplate a phenomenon purely intellectual
and moral, which the uproar raised by the conflict of so
many heterogeneous ideas cannot make me forget, although
it does not intrude itself upon me with violence; on the
contrary, it waits with an unparalleled patience and discretion
at my door. It is the phenomenon named
religion.</p>

<p>We read in the Bible that Moses, having noticed a
burning bush that yet was not consumed, went up to it,
the more closely to investigate this marvel. For many
people religion has borne the same aspect that the burning<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
bush did for Moses, and those, like Moses, have approached
it in the endeavour to discover what it could be. Religion
has always compelled attention, its metaphysical side has
been described in voluminous theological and philosophical
treatises; historians on their side have made many researches
concerning the forms in which it has clothed
itself on earth during a long succession of centuries, and
amongst many peoples; it is even said there are learned
men who have studied all the Bibles and catechisms; and
it is added that few amongst them know what religion
really is. It does not on that account play a less important
part in our existence; it is from religion that all those
acts of devotion and charity spring, to which millions of
human creatures give themselves. There are few who ask
themselves whence comes this breath which inspires them
so fully, and since when has its influence extended itself
amongst us; to be nourished with its fruits sufficed. Such
is the disposition of soul of the majority of those for whom
religion is more than a name&mdash;whatsoever it be&mdash;pronounced
in an unknown tongue. Would it not be natural
to desire to make its acquaintance more closely?
Apparently not; we accept it as something known
by intuition, without concerning ourselves with its
aspect.</p>

<p>This strange fact I have also noticed. When studying
history very attentively, and with an attitude of mind
free from all prejudice, it is possible to fix the exact
period at which errors, more or less generally acknowledged
as such, have first crept into the world; but I have
vainly sought in history for the corresponding moment
when truths first made their appearance; truths, which
have been accepted, if only by a few isolated individuals,
or by certain groups of individuals, of whatever race, or of
whatever period of the life of humanity they might be.
But as it is acknowledged that amongst the errors which
trouble us, we possess some truths, it is evident that they<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
have manifested themselves; but when and how? At this
I do not arrive.</p>

<p>This silence of history indicates, I think, that the truths
of which we seek the commencement have been revealed
to man in prehistoric days. I do not feel that I know
positively concerning the first human beings who appeared
on the earth; I picture them like soft wax ready to receive
a definite form from the hand which created them. These
first comers who knew nothing, never having had any
training, and possessing only their five senses to aid them
in arriving at knowledge, were infinitely better placed than
I am to embrace truth, since I should have to disentangle
myself from a vast mass of ideas which disfigure the
natural simplicity of my soul; I should have to forget,
even the truths which I believed myself to possess, and to
transform myself into white plastic blank wax, with no
impress whatsoever, and to wait until my Creator traced
the image He wished; this is now not possible. I should
not be now here if I could have been contemporaneous
with my ancestors, and I had been permitted to follow
in the steps of their pilgrimage, this would have pleased
me well.</p>

<p>I perceive my friends are uneasy&mdash;“Take care,” they
say, “an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Idée fixe</i> is dangerous.”</p>

<p>But is it quite certain that an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Idée fixe</i> is always
harmful? Have they never seen a man wandering in a
forest without any fixed determination to quit it? Is it
credible that our first parents had no fixed idea of discovering
the import towards themselves, of the vast
world in which they had been placed, knowing nothing of
the reason of their position? Equally ignorant of the
reason why the sun, the moon, fire, hurricanes, storms,
thunder, rivers, mountains existed, always above and
around them. The whole of nature itself required to be
interrogated. In what way could this settled determination
have harmed them? It is true that they are all<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
dead, but determination did not kill them. And their
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Idée fixe</i> must have been very tenacious and powerful for
this thirst for knowledge to have descended with their
blood into our own veins; their wish to gain information
is reproduced in us; this is the legacy that our fathers
have left us, and the singular feature of the legacy is that
unlike others, of which the parts are subdivided and
diminished, this in its entirety has passed down to each of
the milliards and milliards of inheritors.</p>

<p>Must we then feel that we are destined to ask perpetually,
and to receive no answer? That need not be.
Many things that our ancestors could not fathom are
clear to us; what was unknown to them is known to us.
That which prevents us from following up this line of
progress through these phases is that each reply brings
forth anew fresh questions, and thus it will be to the end&mdash;if
the end should ever arrive. This last question we do
not put to ourselves, which is an indication that we are
not careful to arrive at the answer. When I compare the
present state of our knowledge, and of our condition of
mind, to which I have given the epithets of torpor and
inertia&mdash;and they are rightly given&mdash;to that which held
sway in the dark ages when the earth rested on an
elephant, the elephant on a tortoise, and the tortoise swam
in the void, I must acknowledge that we now see things
more truly.</p>

<p>But to start from the point of the sum of our acquired
knowledge in this march of progress would be fatal to us;
the ground we have won will only retain its solidity in
proportion as we keep in sight the path we have trodden,
with all its encountered and vanquished obstacles, and
that will only be by pursuing the same path again in
company with our ancestors.</p>

<p>Here my friends interpose&mdash;“That would be a vain
task, you cannot picture humanity in its infancy, that is
an impossibility.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>Doubtless, and since I am too practical to attempt the
impossible, abstaining from every superhuman effort, and
submitting my imagination to a strict discipline, I will
again consult history, but not history as I know it, nor
that history which is written in our days, polished,
cautious, honestly critical, that which notes the old traces
of humanity when they occur on the route mixed with
events, and which treats the eternal truths as though
they had no existence, and, truly, they do not belong to
its dominion. I would study the other history, which at
first was related, not written, because speech came before
writing. I should try to collect information from the
ancient literatures of the people concerning the manner
in which our ancestors depicted divinity to themselves,
especially with regard to dealings with mortals at the
time when visits between the celestial inhabitants and
those on earth were common.... We possess the Old
Testament of the Hebrews, the sacred books of the
Hindoos, and the mythology of the Aryan family; the
mine is rich, so rich that I should have time to die a
thousand times before I should have finished the task of
searching in this mixed medley of historical remains,
fantastic recitals, sublime thoughts, and flagrant falsehoods.
Happily this work of digging in the past in quest
of an idea is not the work of one man nor of one epoch,
but that of many men and many epochs, and it never
ceases.</p>

<p>Moreover, a short time ago no one imagined that
documents very much more ancient than those I have
just named, would have been discovered in hitherto
unexplored regions of the physical and mental world.
Two enterprising men, Darwin and Max Müller, visited
and studied them. Darwin sought to explain what the
origin of organic beings might have been, and in what
way they passed through a series of evolutions, from
one form to another of great dissimilarity. He who<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
speaks of evolution implies researches into the beginnings
of things; this was exactly what I needed. All the world
knows Darwin’s name, even those who abstain from dealing
with scientific problems; he has some ardent admirers
who are not careful to define very accurately what it is
they admire in him, and some furious adversaries, who,
judging mainly by hearsay, have formed a conception of
him which is either very superficial or very false.</p>

<p>The development of human reason has been one of the
objects of Max Müller’s researches. This great thinker,
who is at the same time the first philologist of our time,
has sought in the science of Language for the origin of
thinking man. Very few amongst the men of the world,
who are nothing more than men of the world, know what
the name of Max Müller represents, even the existence of
a science of Language is unknown to them.</p>

<p>Even if Darwin and Max Müller have not been absolutely
the first to strive to go back, the one to the origin of the
organic world, the other to the dawn of human speech, no
others have yet walked in this darkness so courageously
and so perseveringly as these two men.</p>

<p>Not only have the journeys of exploration been much
multiplied of late, but a principle of action has been
extracted from beneath the scaffolding used in the building
up of new theories; which is, “If you have an idea, and
you wish to see whither it may lead, take it from its first
commencement, and advance confidently.” This is what
I am about to do.</p>

<p>I am undertaking a long journey; I carry with me but
few plans; turning my eyes away from whatever might
attract my curiosity either on the right hand or the left, I
shall still more carefully guard myself from being dazzled by
the mirages which I am told are frequent in those
countries; or frightened by the phantoms which it is
possible I may meet on the road. I shall always remind
myself that one hour of feebleness, indecision, hesitation<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
might cause me to lose my equilibrium, and that it would
only require one moment of dizziness to cause my retrogression
to the elephant and the tortoise. God forbid!
It is to the opposite pole to which I shall direct myself;
if truth exist, reason is here to find it.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HYPOTHESES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Thinkers of all times have asked themselves the question
whence does this world come on which we live. Curious
to know whether the universe was self-made, or was the
work of a great primal ancestor, or personal Creator;
philosophers who considered the matter in its entirety
have left us two hypotheses.</p>

<p>“According to one, chaos reigned at the beginning, or
in other words, the possibility of everything; and from
the midst of this chaos certain realities were evolved,”<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
from an inherent aptitude for development; this aptitude
has been named in many ways, such as “natural
selection,” “survival of the fittest.” The Greek sages
were already acquainted with the thought implied
in these terms. Empedocles said that the fittest
would always preponderate, since conservation is an
integral part of their nature; whilst what is unfit, or
not in accord with the surroundings, must disappear.
But the partisans of this theory find themselves confronted
by a serious difficulty: if a blind force has produced the
universe, whence comes the order which reigns in nature?
It is freely acknowledged, even by those with small powers
of observation, that the inhabitants of the terrestrial globe
are divided into animal and vegetable, which are again
subdivided into distinct classes, separated by distinct lines
of demarcation. If we admitted that the vegetable and
animal kingdoms were not at first so entirely separated as
they are at present, there would always remain a question<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
awaiting reply: How is it to be accounted for, that two
families issuing from the same source, become so separated,
and have remained distinct ever since?</p>

<p>Amongst the propagators of the second hypothesis,
some admit the existence of a primordial germ possessing
the power of infinite production; others believe in a Personal
Creator who formed all things, whether by the means
of pre-existent material or from nothing. In accepting
this theory of a reasonable Being we must at once lay aside
that of pure chance, since to Him is attributed the permanence
of the separation described above, this separation
or division is of such a nature as to induce the impression
that thus it is by premeditation and co-ordination. Certain
philosophers putting aside the question of the origin
of the organic world in its entirety, have restricted their
field of investigation, and taken it in detail. Thus: What
is the origin of man? How is it that man thinks and
speaks? What is human thought and human speech? Is
it man’s nature that compels him to speak, or has language
been from the first a matter of convention? The Greeks
whilst pursuing their researches amongst the lofty regions
of metaphysics expressed some very subtle theories on this
subject, coupled with vast systems which comprehended
the whole of humanity. By these they weighed the words
spoken, their derivation, the ideas which these words represented,
and the primitive source of the various phenomena
exhibited by man, for the ancients recognised man’s indivisibility.</p>

<p>Heraclitus considered that each object combines in itself
a thought and its expression, emanating from the object,
and that man is the recipient only; that he breathes a
spiritual atmosphere; thus it is that every name necessarily
designates the object it denotes.</p>

<p>Plato said that all the objects of the external world have
in them something which constitutes their essence, and
that this essence is capable of being transmitted from<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
objects themselves into the human mind; that ideas constitute
the essence of objects, and that words are therefore
necessarily related to the constituent parts of the objects,
and their impression on the human understanding.</p>

<p>Epicurus said that human language is the result of the
pressure exercised by the external world on the sensitive
essential matter in man, and that as soon as man sustains
this pressure he emits words spontaneously; the most
ancient words used seem to have been expressive sounds,
and with the human race it was as natural for them to
talk as to groan, to cough, or to sneeze.</p>

<p>Thus the Ancients did not distinguish speech from conception.</p>

<p>The problem of the origin of speech, treated in antiquity
with as much depth as calmness, profoundly agitated the
minds in the Middle Ages, and the theologians naturally
introduced this variant in their exposition of the subject:
Has language a divine or human origin? The Christian
philosopher replies: “The intellect of God created the
world, and the human soul, made in the likeness of the
mind of God, has in itself the source of all knowledge:
thought and language are of divine origin; left to himself,
with only the help of his own powers, man would never
have found a means of expressing his thoughts.” Such
was the belief of the greatest thinkers of the Middle
Ages; and they accepted the fact of a primordial language
which men must have received directly from the Creator;
this opinion was perpetuated until the most recent times.
But from the earliest Christian centuries there were certain
philosophers such as Gregory of Nyssa, who, whilst
acknowledging the existence of a primitive universal
language, considered that it redounded more to the glory
of the Almighty Creator to endow man simply with the
power of speech, and they deny that this language with its
grammar and orthography was divinely revealed.</p>

<p>The materials for the study of these questions are lacking.<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
The only document in our possession on the origin
of mankind&mdash;the Old Testament&mdash;was carefully consulted;
there we read that God created man after His image, that
He made him of the dust of the earth, that He breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life, so that man became a
living creature. The Bible narrative is one of simple
facts, and it was necessary to look upon them as so many
facts, for any effort to pierce beneath the surface of these
mysterious words was like groping in the dark. Another
recital was also given in Genesis. God brought all the
animals of the earth, and the birds of the air to Adam
that he might name them, and whatsoever Adam called
every living thing that was the name of it. This seemed
difficult to interpret, and renewed the questions under
other forms. Did man at the beginning resemble a newly
born babe who cries but cannot speak? In this case how
did he begin to express his thoughts? If man was
created an adult, but did not receive a complete language
from heaven, how did he acquire the faculty of speech,
this faculty which we know to be the distinguishing mark
of humanity, and which is missing in other creatures?</p>

<p>The eighteenth century decided that this way of treating
a scientific question left much to be desired; it resulted
in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</i>, and a fresh beginning had to be
made. Some philosophers, thinking to simplify matters,
affirmed that primitive man, tired of wandering through
woods like other animals, decided to group themselves
into companies; the members of this society, feeling the
necessity of making themselves mutually understood, expressed
themselves at first by the aid of signs and
gestures, then by sounds peculiar to the things denoted,
afterwards, in one way or another, actual words were
pronounced. This reasoning was used in the eighteenth
century, and not knowing where to find better, those who
employed it felt satisfied with their perspicacity; language
which was formerly considered as a gift direct from God,<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
became a physiological endowment, a conventional art; this
century had an intense horror of the supernatural, so that
it readily accepted any system in which God did not appear.</p>

<p>The lack of reflection shown in the building up of these
hypotheses concerning the commencement of humanity
has been severely criticised, and that they were very
superficial must be conceded. It is equally clear that all
these tentative efforts had this in common, that they were
the results of the influence on immature minds of the
period, of the necessity of explaining the awakening of
human reason in a rational manner.</p>

<p>The search was continued. At last the nineteenth
century considered that a solution had been found.
Certain ideas which had received attention during divers
periods were now collected, sorted, re-examined more
closely, and classified, and from these labours there arose
the two theories of interjection and imitation. According
to the first, language consists of sounds drawn involuntarily
from man by his emotions and feelings; by degrees man
became accustomed to reproduce similar exclamations when
wishing to express the same feelings, and these exclamations
would serve as the roots of words; this is the interjectional
theory. The imitative or onomatopœic proceeds
from another source; when man was confronted by all the
objects of the exterior world he began to imitate the
sounds emitted, such as the cries of various animals, the
whistling of the wind, the fall of a stone; the many
sounds which fill the air were reproduced by the human
voice and formed the basis for future words. Objections
to both of these theories are not lacking. If emotions
such as joy, pain, anger, love, disgust&mdash;or if physical
sensations such as result from the sting of a bee or from
a blow of the fist, could furnish the roots of a language,
and if it were the same with the imitation of noises produced
by nature, the sounds of the words should retain
a definite impress of these emotions and feelings, and<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
should reproduce, if only approximately, these various
noises. Even if we admit that a small number of primitive
men set themselves to imitate the murmur of the
stream, the rolling of the thunder, the barking of a dog,
the groans of the wounded, the only result would have
been infinite variations of clamour quite impossible to
distinguish or to understand. Strictly speaking, the prolonged
sound of “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bée</i>” and “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mou</i>” might awaken the conception
of a goat and cow in the mind; but in order to
convey the idea of a herd of oxen it would be necessary
to avoid equally the sound of “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bée</i>” and “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mou</i>,” as belonging
exclusively to the two special animals. The warbling notes
of birds have always attracted attention, and essays have
been made to reproduce them by imitative harmony, but
the various peoples have given various interpretations,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
in the generality of cases there is no resemblance between
the names of animals and their cries.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> After examining
the testimony of the name “cuckoo” (no doubt convincing
taken by itself), which is the prominent argument brought
forward by the advocates of the imitative theory called by
Max Müller the bow-wow theory, we are not able to
advance further in that direction. Darwin in his book,
<cite>The Descent of Man</cite>, promulgates the idea that language
may have originated from interjections and imitations, but
elsewhere in the <cite>Expressions of the Emotions</cite> he hastens
to add with his accustomed frankness: “But the whole subject
of the differences of the sounds produced under different<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
states of the mind is so obscure that I have succeeded in
throwing hardly any light on it; and the remarks which I
have made have but little significance.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Scholars and literary men have taxed the resources of
all the treasures of their imagination in endeavouring to
picture the beginnings of language; in the present day
many efforts are made by learned men to discover, from
nurses surrounded by their charges, how the first words
were reproduced by primitive man. It would be as useful
to study the nature of primitive rocks amongst a mass of
bricks and mortar, since the chasm is wide between the
thoughts which our little ones have when they first begin
to speak and those which primitive man had in trying to
name his surroundings. We who speak because we know
point out father or mother to a little child, naming them
at the same time&mdash;“this is mother,” “this is father;” by
degrees attributes become connected in the child’s mind
with these names; such as mother’s hair, or her dress; or
father’s beard, his pin; and whilst naming them we again
point them out; and when the child pronounces these
words in its own fashion, that is incorrectly, is this defect
in pronunciation to be a sign-post to us&mdash;pointing out
the direction to be followed in judging of primitive language?
At a later period the child distinguishes between
the mother’s smile and the father’s voice; later still its
mind comprehends all the moral and physical attributes
covered by these two terms; and thus with all other
objects&mdash;“here is the cow,” and “here is the piece of
sugar,” which so soon become familiar to the child, with
their cognate words, milk and sweetness. Our children
thus learn to speak under very different conditions from
those in which our first ancestors found themselves, when
with no previous experience they tried to put forth their
first words.</p>

<p>Conjectures increased and developed into systems,<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
which, however, contained nothing beyond germs of fresh
conjectures and fresh systems, of which none rested on a
reasonable basis.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century it was quite
natural that there should be uncertainty as to the path to
be followed in seeking the beginning of human speech.
Was it necessary to trace all the known languages to
their source? Would not the same feeling of confusion
arise when attacking all the dialects spoken on the surface
of the earth as oppressed those who were at the base of
the Tower of Babel? An idea which was universally
adopted rather tended to check the progress of this
study: it sprang from the theory that humanity had
received the gift of speech from the Creator; and as the
Jewish people alone were thought to be the recipients of
a supernatural revelation, it followed that Hebrew must
be the earliest language, and consequently that all existing
languages were derived from the Hebrew. It is hardly
possible to conceive the number of works put forth by the
learned to remove any doubt with regard to this strange
affiliation; the difficulty was to support or prove the supposition
that Hebrew had given birth to Greek, Latin, and
the rest; this Biblical language was tortured and twisted
about in the endeavour to prove the descent of the others
from it, but no satisfactory result was obtained. It was
by the advice of Leibniz that as many facts as possible
were collected concerning the modern languages then in
use. He asked for the assistance of monarchs, European
princes, ambassadors, missionaries, and travellers. It was
during these investigations that the attention of certain
philologists was directed to Sanscrit, a language which had
been dead 300 years before the Christian era, and about
which the learned in Europe had troubled themselves very
little.</p>

<p>At the time of Plato and Aristotle a vague notion was
current in Greece that India, as well as Egypt, was the<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
birthplace of matchless learning, only it was not known in
what this learning consisted, and even the name of the
Vedas (the most ancient collection of sacred writings of
the Hindoos) was unknown to the philosophers. The first
Christian writers who mentioned the religions of India, and
who knew up to a certain point how to distinguish Brahminism
from Buddhism, never quoted the Vedas; this
name is first used by some Chinese converts to Buddhism,
at the beginning of the Christian era, who had undertaken
a pilgrimage to India, considered by them as a holy land.
In the sixteenth century Francis Xavier went there as a
missionary, but without knowing Sanscrit; in the seventeenth
century Roberto de Nobili, another missionary,
acquired the language, and caused a compilation to be
made of Hindoo and Christian doctrines. It was not well
done; the French translation was sent to Voltaire, who
praised it and spoke of it as the most precious gift for
which the West had ever been indebted to the East. The
Père Calmette, who had heard of the importance of the
Vedas, was the first European to obtain authentic fragments,
but these attracted little attention in Europe. In
the early part of the nineteenth century some members of
the Asiatic Society residing in Calcutta discovered a collection
of Sanscrit MSS., amongst them some portions of the
laws of Manu, two epic poems, the Râmayana and the
Mahâbhârata, some philosophical treatises, works on
astronomy and medicine, plays and fables. These works
possessed great interest for those scholars who were occupied
with the study of humanity, such as Herder, Schlegel,
Goethe, and Humboldt. For the most part the preconceived
ideas with which these literary men received them
tended to diminish the benefit to be derived from them to
a great extent, as they endeavoured&mdash;consistently with the
spirit of the time&mdash;to establish the identity of thought
running through the sacred literature of the Hindoos and the
Bible. They also sought to point out the supposed connection<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
between the historical recitals of the Old Testament,
the Indian legends, and the Greek and Latin mythologies.
Certain MSS. containing passages from the sacred code
of the Hindoos having been translated by Anquetil
Duperron, Schopenhauer drew from it the foundations of his
own philosophical belief; nothing less than the genius of
this German scholar would have sufficed for the presentation
of the sublime truths which the original contained,
by means of this very defective translation. One of the
first historiographers of Buddhism was the Abbé Barthelemy
Saint-Hilaire, but yet his labours have not served to raise
the veil hiding the true meaning of the Brahman writings,
for without the knowledge of the early Sanscrit, it was not
possible to seize the inner meaning of a literature which
the sages of India had required fifteen centuries to complete.
Thus it was that Europe only knew the more
accessible portions, and those better calculated to strike
the imagination, but not necessarily the most important.
“Much had been said and written about Buddhism, enough
to show the Roman Catholic clergy that the <a id="Ref_23" href="#R_Ref_23">Lamas</a> of
Thibet had anticipated them in the use of auricular
confession, the rosary, and the tonsure; and to disconcert
philosophers by showing them that they were outdone in
positivism and nihilism by the inmates of Chinese
monasteries.”<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The strangeness of this religion attracted public attention,
which was especially directed towards certain
blemishes, which had crept into it during a decadent
period, and tarnished its original purity, and although
learned men continued to devote themselves to a study
more and more deeply penetrated with the Sanscrit
language, they were yet so unprepared for the results
which must inevitably follow this study, that certain
German universities became the scenes of veritable
scandals, when some of the learned declared that they<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
had found a community of origin between the people of
Athens, of Rome, and of India, and the stupefaction of the
philologists knew no bounds when, in 1833, Bopp’s work
appeared, <cite>The Comparative Grammar of the Greek, Latin,
Gothic, Sanscrit, Zend, Lithuanian, Slavonic, and
German Languages</cite>, whilst the effect on the younger
students was quite bewildering.</p>

<p>But that which created the greatest furore in all Europe
was the promulgation of the scientific discoveries of Eugène
Burnouf, Professor of Oriental Languages in the Collège de
France. Long centuries had passed during which no
original Sanscrit document had come to light, and now in
the short space of ten years three complete collections of
Oriental literature were known, the sacred books of the
Brahmans, of the Buddhists, and of the Magians. “The
critical examination and restitution of the Zend texts, the
outlines of a Zend grammar, the translation and philological
anatomy of considerable portions of the Zoroastrian
writings were the work of the learned young French
scholar.”<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A few proper names and certain titles were up to this
time all that could be deciphered of the cuneiform inscriptions
on the walls of Persian palaces. Classical or
oriental scholars had hitherto only seen in them a quaint
conglomeration of nails, wedges, or arrows; but when at
last the meaning was disentangled, it suddenly flashed
upon the discoverers that there was a close relationship
between languages hitherto held to be quite distinct.
Facts, at first only suspected, now received full confirmation;
those previously unknown were discovered and
claimed, if only provisionally, in the name of Science.
Historians and philologists pressed eagerly into this new
path. In looking back they could see that the human
family was divided into three distinct groups, the Semetic
family, the Aryan family&mdash;sometimes called the Indo-Germanic&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
the Turanian class, the northern division
of which has the name Ural-Altaic given to it occasionally.
I use the word <em>class</em> advisedly, as the characteristic traits
hardly merit the rank of family. They also discovered
that human speech had equally marked divisions, making
three groups or families, corresponding to the three great
human races. The Semetic family produced the Hebrew
of the Old Testament, the Arabic of the Koran, and the
ancient language graven on the monuments of Phœnicia
and Carthage, of Babylon and Assyria; the Greek and
Latin, Persian and Sanscrit, the Germanic languages,
Celtic and Slavonic, all belong to the Aryan family; from
the Ural-Altaic group come the Tungusic, Mongolic,
Turkic, Samoyedic and Finnic; there still remains the
Chinese language, which is monosyllabic and stands by
itself, the only remnant of the earliest formation of human
speech.</p>

<p>These discoveries caused a complete change in the
methods adopted by philologists; at the present time the
ancient systems of the classification of tongues are entirely
abandoned. The comparative philologist ignores altogether
geographical locality, the varying ages of languages,
and their classical or illiterate character. Languages are
now classified genealogically, according to their real
relationship; and Hebrew, coming down from its pedestal,
took its natural place amongst the languages of the
Semetic family.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I revert here for a moment to the past in order to quote
a page from Plato, which shows us the small esteem in
which the purely speculative method, in the treatment of
philosophy, was held by one of the profoundest minds of
antiquity:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dost thou see that very tall plane-tree?” said
Phædros to Socrates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly, I do.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Socrates, is it not from the foot of this plane-tree
that they say Boreas carried away Oreithyia from the
Ilissos?”</p>

<p>“So they say.”</p>

<p>“But tell me, O Socrates, dost thou believe this mythe
to be true?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I did not believe it, like the wise people, I
should not be so very far wrong; and I might set up an
ingenious theory and say that a gust of Boreas, the north
wind, carried her down from the rocks in the neighbourhood,
and that having died in this manner, she was
reported to have been carried off by Boreas from thence.
As for myself, Phædros, I think these explanations, on the
whole, very pleasant; a man is, after all, not much to be
envied, if it were only for this, that when he has set right
this one fable, he is bound to do the same for a second,
then a third, and thus much time is lost. I, at least,
have no leisure to spare for these things, and the reason,
my friend, is this, that I cannot yet, according to the
Delphic line, know myself; and it seems to me ridiculous
that a man who does not yet know this, should trouble
himself about what does not concern him. Therefore I
leave these things alone, and, believing what other people
believe about them, I meditate, as I said just now, not on
them, but on myself&mdash;whether I be a monster more complicated
and more savage than Typhon, or a tamer and
simpler creature, enjoying by nature a blessed and modest
lot.”<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>“Thus, to the mind of Socrates, man was pre-eminently
the individual ... he is ever seeking to solve the
mystery of human nature by brooding over his own mind,
by watching the secret workings of the soul, by analysing
the organs of knowledge, and by trying to determine its
proper limits; and thus the last result of his philosophy<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
was that he knew but one thing, and this was, that he
knew nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>More than 2300 years have elapsed since the intercourse
between Socrates and his disciple took place. But
the problems which we of the twentieth century have
not yet succeeded in solving, have so entirely absorbed our
attention, that it seldom occurs to us to measure the distance
which separates us from the commencement of
philosophical studies. Although the scientific equipment
of our forefathers occupies a small portion of our thoughts
in our leisure moments, we yet discover&mdash;in comparison
with ourselves&mdash;how very indigent they were.</p>

<p>This earth was unintelligible to the Greeks, they looked
upon it as a solitary being, without a peer in the whole
universe; to us it is a planet; one of many, all governed
by the same laws, all moving round the same centre. It
is the same with man who also remained a riddle to the
ancients. An intelligent study of the world’s history,
which they knew but imperfectly, has enriched our
language with a word which never passed the lips of
Socrates, Plato or Aristotle&mdash;humanity. Where the
Greeks saw barbarians, that is, human beings other than
themselves&mdash;we see brethren; those whom they called
heroes and demi-gods are our ancestors; those who
appeared to them strangers, united by no ties, are to
us one family in work and suffering, divided by language
and severed by national enmity, but pressing forward step
by step almost unconsciously towards the fulfilment of that
inscrutable purpose for which the world was created. As
we have ceased to see in nature the working of demons or
the manifestation of an evil principle, so we deny in history
an atomistic conglomerate of chances, or the despotic rule
of a mute fate; we turn over the leaves of the past seeking
for a hidden train of thought in the actions of the
human race; we understand that every effect has its cause;<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
that connecting links run through the moral world, as well
as the physical world; that there is nothing irrational in
either history or nature, and we believe that the human
mind is called upon to discover in both the manifestations
of a Divine Power, the source of our existence.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This result, however, we could not have attained without
first recognising the fact that man is no isolated being,
complete in himself; that if he is to be effectively studied
he cannot be disassociated from his family, all the members
of which are governed by the same laws, all move round
the same centre, and all receive their light from the same
focal point. He is one of a class, of one genus or kind,
whom it would be impossible to estimate correctly, if we
set aside his relations to his fellows.</p>

<p>“To understand man,” an illustrious naturalist has said
recently, “it is not sufficient <em>not</em> to separate him from
those whom he resembles in every point; it is quite as
necessary to study him in connection with those closely
related to him, the inferior animals.”</p>

<p>Hitherto I have not mentioned a hypothesis which has
been promulgated in our days on the origin of man,
which would have been considered the most remarkable
this century had seen, had it not appeared simultaneously
with another treatment of a like subject equally noticeable
for its profundity in another direction.</p>

<p>During a voyage which he made in South America,
Darwin had been struck by the very close affinity
which existed between the living and the fossil species of
this continent; this link between the past and present
appeared to him to throw considerable light on the
obscurity which enveloped the question of the origin of
species. The degree in which organs were capable of
modification was especially to be taken into account; the
study of the variation of animals and plants under
domestication led Darwin to the path he followed; the<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
uninterrupted reproduction of characteristics in the
structure of organic beings, intensified rather than
attenuated by a succession of modifications, caused him
to see in all living creatures, not independent entities,
the one apart from the other, but descendants from
common ancestors now extinct.</p>

<p>Evolution, like many another theory, may be dangerous
if not thoroughly grasped, and if it lead to a denial of the
permanence of the well marked lines of demarcation in
nature. Evolution, according to Darwin, starts from
beginnings which are quite distinct; and leads on to
well defined ends; thus Darwin does not acknowledge
only one common progenitor for all the great natural
races, but many, and nothing more clearly demonstrates
his transparent sincerity in scientific matters than what
his critics are pleased to call his inconsistencies.</p>

<p>At the end of many years of persistent labour, Darwin
published his book on the <cite>Origin of Species</cite>.</p>

<p>I do not propose to give a summary of it. The author
does not adopt the method of a learned writer expounding
his system; his attitude is that of a naturalist who, during
his excursions, examines nature in its innumerable and
most minute details; when two facts, both of which he
considers true, appear to contradict each other, he notes
both equally, since he is too sincere to conceal that one
from the public which apparently invalidates his theory.
Moreover at each step he avows that this theory is not
yet entirely free from the fog which invariably envelops
each new idea at its birth. An explorer such as he is,
who has succeeded in explaining so many mysteries, might
very naturally become elated, but it is not so with him;
his thoughts never seem directed towards himself; with
all his genius, self does not appear to exist with him; the
only things that are prominent&mdash;with a distinct existence&mdash;are
the phenomena which he studies.</p>

<p>The notion that all organic beings have been such as we<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
now see them from the beginning, was almost inevitable,
as long as the theory was held that the formation of the
world was of comparatively recent date; and those who,
without further investigation, held the traditional belief
of the independent and individual creation of each species,
could only offer one explanation, if all animals&mdash;all
plants&mdash;are as they are it is because it has pleased the
Creator to make them so. Because the Darwinian theory
has cast a doubt on the successive creation of living things,
it has been said that Darwin’s views were inimical to
religion. These impressions are transitory&mdash;as were those
expressed by Leibniz when he reproached Newton with
introducing “occult qualities and miracles into philosophy;”<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and when he attacked his law of gravitation
“as subversive of natural, and inferentially of revealed
religion.”<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>After explaining in what manner nature had produced
all the variations of plants and inferior animals from a
small number of germs, Darwin did not feel himself under
the necessity of adding one more to the germs in order
that what was afterwards termed humanity might appear
on the scene; the principle of evolution as already applied
to the organic world, would suffice to explain all difficulties;
the natural forces all engaged in the same movement,
would spread and branch out in various directions,
until they reached the culminating point of incorporation
with the human creature.</p>

<p>Darwin’s book, the <cite>Descent of Man</cite>, contains the
genealogical table of this higher animal which the author
so often compares with the lower animals. If both have
so much in common, such as the chemical composition of
their bodies&mdash;their germinal vesicles&mdash;their laws of growth
and reproduction; it is&mdash;so he conceives&mdash;that both have
come from the same ancestor; moreover, all helps to prove
that man has received from his prototype amongst the<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
mammifers, all the special characteristics of its own organs.
Thus it is easy to understand that in the eyes of many
naturalists the embryonic structure is of more importance
for an accurate classification than that of an adult, since
the embryo is that condition in which the animal has
undergone the least modification, thus it better represents
the original form of the primitive progenitor.</p>

<p>For a species of one of the inferior animals to have
attained the level of man, it was necessary that, following
an universal law, it must have undergone variations both
corporally and mentally, during a long succession of
generations; the primary causes of these variations is not
clearly understood, but it has been proved that the conditions
of life or environment to which the living beings
submitted were potent agents in the renewal of phenomena.
Like all other creatures man increased out of all
proportion to his means of subsistence, and thus began
the struggle for existence, when those who were best
equipped for the fight survived in the greatest numbers,
and left the greatest number of robust descendants. Man
acquired the capability of expressing his wants by means
of language, at first, perhaps, little different from that of
the inferior animals, but the continued use of language
reacting on the brain furnished a means for the further
development of those mental faculties which of themselves
constitute a real distinction between man and beast. This
difference, however, does not become pronounced until a
certain period of man’s existence, as during the earliest
stages the intelligence of the newly created human beings
does not differ from that of other mammifers. It begins to
dawn a little later, then gradually increases, and at last
becomes most strongly marked, even if a comparison be
made between the intelligence of a highly developed
monkey and that of the lowest savage, who has failed perhaps
to find words with which to express the most
elementary emotions. But men are not all on the same<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
level; without speaking of the vast difference that exists
between the faculties of a Papuan and those which we
know to have been possessed by a Newton or a Kant, we
notice a very sensible difference between the mental
powers of two individuals of the same race; but we always
find these extremes are connected by shades of difference
which gradually melt imperceptibly the one into the
other. Darwin arrives at the conclusion that the distinctions
to be drawn between the intellect of man and
the intelligence of animals is one of degree rather than of
kind.</p>

<p>Darwin shares the opinion of those who consider the
moral consciousness in man as that which distinguishes
him specially from the inferior animals, and he conceives
its origin to be found in the social instincts whose most
important constituent parts are family ties and the emotions
to which they give rise. This consciousness makes man
capable of approving of certain acts and disapproving of
others. After having been overcome by a temporary passion,
he reflects and compares the already weakened
motives causing him to act as he did, with the appeal
made to him by his family and social instincts, and he
resolves to act differently in the future; the opinion of his
neighbours influences him, but it is not so much the
opinion of the community in general as that of his own
small circle to which he belongs.</p>

<p>Social instincts are found also amongst a large number
of inferior animals, but with them, this mutual sympathy
does not extend to all the species of their class, as with
man it reaches only to the members of their own small
community.</p>

<p>With the progress of civilisation and in proportion as
the smaller communities become larger, so man’s reason
leads him to extend his sympathy to all the men of his
nationality; arrived at this point, there remains a very
impalpable barrier between that and the inclusion of men<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
of all races in feelings of universal benevolence; but if
these races are separated from his by strong dissimilarities
in external appearance and in habits of life, it would take
much time for him to learn and recognise in them the
constituent parts of humanity similar to himself.</p>

<p>The moral consciousness which raises man to a level
not attained by beasts, leads him to conceive and apprehend
the precept, “Do unto others as you would they
should do unto you.” The sympathy which extends
beyond the limits of humanity, such as compassion for
animals, seems the last quality to be developed. The
moral sense in man has its counterpart in animals of the
inferior order; under the influence of man the animal becomes
more capable of improvement by the increased
exercise of his intelligence, by habits, by instincts of
heredity, so as to have transformed the prototype of the
wolf and jackal to that of a dog.</p>

<p>There is nothing to lead us to suppose that primitive
man had felt the existence of a principle higher than
nature. There is much to indicate that what we mean by
religious feeling was not known to him; but the aspect of
the question undergoes a change if by religious sentiment
we understand belief in invisible spirits, for this belief was
universal. This is natural; as soon as certain faculties of
the imagination awoke in man, such as astonishment,
curiosity, he would seek to understand all that passed
around him; his first idea would be that all the phenomena
in nature would proceed from the presence inherent
in them of a power compelling to action in the same
way as man feels himself obliged to act. This belief in
the course of age would easily tend towards fetishism, then
to polytheism and finally to monotheism; it would simultaneously
inculcate many strange superstitions, of which
some produced terrible effects, such as the sacrifice of
human lives to a powerful being eager for human blood,
since savages readily attribute to these superior powers the<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
desire for vengeance as well as all the other evil passions
they themselves possess.</p>

<p>Amongst civilised peoples the conception of an all-knowing,
an all-seeing God, exercises a powerful influence on
morality; man learns little by little, no longer to regard
the praise or blame of society as his sole guide; this
external guidance is replaced by personal inward convictions
which come from his reason and which is conscience.
Religious devotion is a very complex human sentiment; it
is composed of love, submission, gratitude, hope, and perhaps
of other elements; no creature is in a position to
experience so complicated an emotion whose intellectual
faculties have not attained a level of medium development.
Yet something approaching this may be seen in the depth
of affection manifested by a dog for his master, which is a
combination of complete submission, of fear, dependence,
and perhaps also of other qualities.</p>

<p>Learned writers have for some time agreed in looking
upon language as the barrier separating man from animals;
all books on logic state the fact. But this special characteristic
of the human race attracted Darwin’s attention
in a very small degree. “Man, however, at first, uses, in
common with the lower animals, inarticulate cries to
express his meaning, aided by gestures and the movements
of the muscles of the face.”<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> “Certain animals,” he says,
“do not lack the physical conditions necessary for articulate
language, since there is not a letter in the alphabet that a
parrot cannot pronounce.” Darwin goes even beyond
this. “It is not the mere power of articulation that
distinguishes man from other animals, but it is his
large power of connecting definite sounds with definite
ideas.”<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult to be more explicit, and it must
be owned that this was a great concession on Darwin’s part;
but afterwards, and perhaps with the object of weakening<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
the force of this statement, he adds: “The fact of the
higher apes not using their vocal organs for speech, no
doubt depends on their intelligence not having been sufficiently
advanced.”<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> However, no effort of thought, in
the present state of our knowledge, would cause us to
understand how any number of thousands of centuries
passed in roaring and barking could enable wolves and
dogs to join a single definite idea to a single definite
sound; and if we said that, by the help of specially
favourable environments some unknown species of primitive
animal had acquired the power of speech, and had
succeeded in imparting the knowledge to its descendants,
and in thus elevating them to the level of human
beings, we should only be relating fantastic tales, which
would have no connection with scientific research.</p>

<p>Darwin does not allow himself to be affected by
this consideration. “In a series of forms graduating
insensibly from some ape-like creature to man as he
now exists, it would be impossible to fix on any definite
point where the term ‘man’ ought to be used.”<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It
is evident that if the gradations were imperceptible,
there would be no possibility of marking the precise point
where the animal ended and man began; “the admission
of this insensible gradation would eliminate, not only the
difference between ape and man, but likewise between
black and white, hot and cold, a high and a low note in
music; in fact, it would do away with the possibility of
all exact and definite knowledge, by removing those
wonderful lines and laws of nature which ... enable us
to count, to tell, and to know.”<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I will now bring together some passages which are
scattered in various parts of the <cite>Origin of Species</cite> and the
<cite>Descent of Man</cite> which have especially attracted criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“It is interesting to note that all that we are, all that
we see, has been produced by laws acting around us.
These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with
Reproduction; Inheritance, which is almost implied by
reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse;
a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life,
and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence
of Character and the Extinction of less-improved
forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and
death, the most exalted object which we are capable of
conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals,
directly follows.”<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>And again: “There is grandeur in this view of life,
with its several powers, having been originally breathed
by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “Man
may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen,
though not through his own exertions, to the very summit
of the organic scale; and the fact of his having thus risen,
instead of having been aboriginally placed there, may give
him hopes for a still higher destiny in the distant future.”<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
“In the future I see open fields for far more important
researches. Psychology will be securely based on
newly laid down foundations; that of the necessary
acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.
Much light will be thrown on the origin of man
and his history.”<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Again elsewhere: “The moral sense or conscience, as
Mackintosh remarks, has a rightful supremacy over every
other principle of human action. It is summed up in
that short but imperious word <em>ought</em>,” and Darwin proceeds
to quote Kant’s apostrophe as follows: “Duty! wondrous
thought, that workest neither by fond insinuation, flattery,<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy naked
law in the soul, and so extorting for thyself always
reverence, if not always obedience; before whom all
appetites are dumb, however secretly they rebel. Duty!
whence thy original?”<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Darwin continues: “This great question, ‘Whence thy
origin?’ has been discussed by many writers of consummate
ability; and my sole excuse for touching on it is ...
that, as far as I know, no one has approached it exclusively
from the side of natural history.”<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“But as the feelings of love and sympathy and the
power of self-command become strengthened by habit,
and as the power of reasoning becomes clearer, so that
man can appreciate the justice of the judgments of his
fellow-men, he will feel himself impelled, independently
of any pleasure or pain felt at the moment, to risk his life
for his fellow-creature, or to sacrifice himself for any great
cause. He may then say, I am the supreme judge of my
own conduct, and, in the words of Kant, I will not in my
own person violate the dignity of humanity.”<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The warmest admirers of Darwin wish that he had
expressed himself more definitely. Some amongst them
are astonished to find the word “<em>Creator</em>” in certain
editions of the <cite>Origin of Species</cite>, and not in all; others
have drawn attention to the fact that Darwin could say in
all good faith, “I see no good reason why the views given
in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any
one.”<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Darwin’s line of thought has perhaps not been perfectly
grasped, and his commentators have been numerous.
This, however, is certain. From the moment when the
author of the <cite>Descent of Man</cite> considered that he had
discovered in social instincts the first germ of the idea of<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
duty, it becomes a matter for surprise that he yielded to
the desire of referring to Kant and of quoting his apostrophe
to Duty. But it is quite evident that Darwin did
not see in the universe only the fortuitous result of a
combination of matter; he admitted the existence of a law
acting from the beginning and continuing to act. In
order the better to grasp his thought, it is necessary to
be in a position to define his terms. He speaks of natural
selection, but in ordinary parlance selection presupposes
the existence of distinction and judgment; and to
distinguish and choose, intelligence is necessary; and
if the essential nature is intelligent, what is this
nature?</p>

<p>The endeavour to prove that man has descended from a
creature not originally man has deeply stirred our generation,
and the greater number amongst us only yielded
to a natural repugnance in repulsing the idea with
indignation. However, because this inward feeling tells
us that a proposition is false, it does not necessarily follow
that it is so; in looking at it more closely, we have to
admit that many humiliating facts are accepted by us
without demur. We are not scandalised at the notion of
being composed of the same chemical elements as the
inferior animals, nor do we revolt against the injustice of
the circumstances and restraints imposed upon all by the
facts of birth and death; but this unreasoning submission
has no more rational basis than the revolt of our feelings,
in presence of the assumption, that an animal only was
our ancestor. The notion that animals so dissimilar as
the monkey, the elephant, the bird, fish, and man could
have proceeded from the same parentage seems too
monstrous to be true; from the scientific point of view
this feeling is of no value; in the face of all the assertions
of our moral convictions science, as such, remains immovable;
the only weapon admitted in a scientific
encounter is fact opposed to fact, argument to argument.<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
Moreover, any appeals which can be made to our pride,
our dignity, our piety, would be equally wide of the mark,
so long as proof is lacking that man possesses something
which has no existence in lower animals either actually or
potentially.</p>

<p>It is a matter for regret to have to acknowledge the
fact that the union of a profound knowledge, combined
with true sincerity in research, is insufficient to endow
the world with a well established truth. The world is
too hasty in accepting or rejecting a new system before
giving itself the trouble to divide the system into two
parts, one of which can be placed at once amongst evident
truths, whilst the other must be subjected to minute
investigation and close testing. Precisely after this
manner does Darwin’s work lend itself to a division into
two parts, the former is the history of the formation and
gradual development of the organic world, represented by
plants and animals, including man (<cite>The Origin of Species</cite>),
but it is also the history of the formation and gradual
development of man considered as a being composed of
body and spirit (<cite>Descent of Man</cite>). In the author’s mind
this portion of the subject is closely connected with the
former.</p>

<p>At first sight it would appear that a tribunal, which
was quick to distinguish truth from error in this teaching,
had not been found. Certainly scientific materialism has
no voice in the matter, since its mission is only to deal
with material and actual facts; and when from the facts
accumulated conclusions are deduced as applied to origins,
this would be out of its sphere, and the conclusions reached
can only be arbitrary; thus Darwin’s theory not being
found free from the taint of idealism, it was condemned
without trial. Religious dogmatism did not show itself
any more capable of deciding the question, for this
dogmatism, whose domain is faith, considered that due
reference was not made to Divine intervention, and<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
concluded that the theory was only judged by the light of
science, and thus condemned it unheard. But all condemnation,
which cannot prove itself to be just, has no
scientific value, only one tribunal is competent of judging
and solving the question, and that is the science of
language, it alone possesses documentary evidence. The
exact point at which the animal ceases and man begins
can be determined with precision since it coincides with
the beginning of the “Radical Period” of language, and
language is reason.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">OUR ARYAN ANCESTORS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Some of the studies undertaken and carried on in a
tentative groping fashion, with the purpose of ascertaining
the nature of that complex being man, have been placed
before you. I have mentioned the more or less fantastic
suppositions set forth on the subject, and I have dwelt
rather more fully on a recent system, of which the
fundamental portion (a magnificent scientific monument,
to which experimental tests have given a solid basis) is
followed by a second part which treats especially of the
descent of man. The time has now come to examine the
studies of a school of philosophy, which, guided by a new
theory, searches in the past, and passes under review all
previous conceptions, suppositions, or even misconceptions
of the previous schools.</p>

<p>The science of language, based on the close connection
between thought and speech, only dates back to the
beginning of the nineteenth century. The first problem
presented to it is that of origin&mdash;the origin of thought
and speech in man&mdash;which two united in their essential
parts, make man what he is. The means by which this
science works is called comparative philology; it is by the
analysis of languages&mdash;living as well as dead&mdash;that it
seeks to discover the infancy of human thought. It is
evident that in order to penetrate thus deeply, this
analysis must follow the whole progress of speech since it
first sounded; to no other school of philosophy had this
idea occurred; all others ignored the fact that previous to
the commencement of human language, no vestige of<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
humanity could exist; therefore, probably, another fact
had been ignored; that the only archives in which it is
possible to study the history of humanity and the
development of reason are those of language.</p>

<p>Wherever sacred writings exist, we find in them the most
ancient languages of the people who possess them; this is
the case in Persia, China, Palestine, Arabia, and India;
thus it is in these writings which are looked upon as being
divinely inspired, that search must be made for the genesis
of the successive thought of these peoples.</p>

<p>But these ancient writings differ widely the one from
the other; for the most part they contain ideas which are
the product of various ages; often also, as in Greece, and
Rome and Persia, we find ourselves confronted by thoughts
or theories which had already arrived at a high degree of
development, or are beginning to lose their first clearness.
Only amongst the Hindoos is it possible to follow step by
step the growth of the conception, and the transformation
of the names which clothe them. The Vedas show us
more clearly than any other literary monument in the
world, the uninterrupted course of the evolution of
language and thought from the first word pronounced by
our ancestors to our own most recent reflection.</p>

<p>India does not possess remains of ancient temples nor
of ancient palaces. Edifices of this kind were probably
unknown before the invasion of Alexander. The Hindoos
have always felt themselves strangers in the land, and the
constant efforts of the kings of Egypt and of Babylon to
perpetuate their names during thousands of years, by
means of bricks and blocks of stone, did not occur to them
until suggested by foreigners. But on the other hand,
from the most remote times, they have possessed sacred
writings, and they still preserve them in their ancient form.
The number of separate works in Sanscrit of which the
manuscripts are still in existence is now estimated at more
than ten thousand. What would Plato and Aristotle have<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
said, had they been told that there existed in that India
which Alexander had just discovered&mdash;if not conquered&mdash;an
ancient literature, far richer than anything they possessed
at that time in Greece, and dating back so far that the
old Sanscrit which clothed the religious and philosophical
thought of these early inhabitants was a dead language.
This literature has not ceased to increase, and contains the
canonical books of the three principal religions of the ancient
world; the Zend-Avesta, the sacred books of the Magians,
written in Zend, the ancient Persian; the Tripitaka, the
sacred books of the Buddhists, which contain moral
treatises, dogmatic philosophy, and metaphysics; and the
sacred writings of the Brahmans called the Vedas.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say whether the Old Testament,
or certain portions of the Vedas, have existed for the
greater number of centuries; it is certain that the Aryan
race had no existence previous to the Vedas. The name
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Veda</i> signifies “knowing, or knowledge”; veda, Greek
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰδα</i>, is a verb with the same meaning in Sanscrit as
in Greek, “I know.” The book of the Vedas contains an
epitome of the most ancient Brahmanic science, and is
composed of four collections of hymns; that which is
called Rig-Veda (hymns of praise) is the true Veda, and
the other Vedas are to the Rig-Veda what the Talmud is
to the Bible. The Rig-Veda, which for more than three
thousand years had laid the foundations of the moral and
religious life of innumerable millions of human creatures
had never been published until Max Müller put forth a
complete edition, accompanied by authorised commentaries
on Indian theology.</p>

<p>The composition of these hymns occupied many centuries,
and in 600 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the collection seems to have been
complete. Some early treatises on these hymns tell us that
at this date the theological schools had accomplished a great
undertaking, that of counting every verse, every word,
every syllable of the hymns; the number of syllables is<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
432,000, the number of words 153,826, and the number
of verses as computed in these treatises varies from 10,402
to 10,622. Until the introduction of writing, the Vedic
hymns were entirely preserved by memory, with such
accuracy and fidelity that the rules contained in the treatise
for the repetitions correspond with great exactness
with the actual text, its accents, metre, and the divinity it
praises. The Rig-Veda now forms the foundation of all
philological and mythological studies, as well as those connected
with the science and growth of religion; without
it we should never have obtained any insight into the
belief of our ancestors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now transport ourselves to the cradle of the
Aryas “Noble,” according to some writers situated on the
Asiatic continent, according to others more to the north,
between the Baltic and the Caspian seas. This will suffice
for the first stage; I shall make few demands on history,
or on grammar.</p>

<p>There was a time when the great mass of the Aryan
people was hesitating on the eve of abandoning their early
habitations, previous to a dispersion in two directions.
This people was composed of two branches, the tribes of
the north, and those of the south; the former went
towards the north-west of Asia and Europe; here they
established themselves, and the great historical nations&mdash;historical,
since most of them have played noted parts
amongst the nations&mdash;the Celts, Grecians, Romans,
Germans and Slavs were their descendants. Endowed
with every aptitude for an active life, they fostered these
capabilities to the highest degree; society was founded by
them, morals brought to a greater perfection, the foundation
of science and art established, and the principles of
philosophy laid down. Although constantly in conflict
with the Semitic and Turanian races, these Aryans became
in their descendants the masters of the world. Whilst the<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
northern division followed a north-westerly direction, the
southern went to the mountains lying to the north of
India; crossing the passes of the Himalayas, and following
the long watercourses, they descended into the vast fertile
valleys, and from that time India became as their own
land. These pleasant dwelling-places of the Aryan
colonists, protected on the one side by high mountains,
and on the other by the ocean from all foreign invasions,
were not disturbed by any of the ancient conquerors of
the world; around them kingdoms rose and fell, dynasties
were created and became extinct, but the inner life of the
tribes remained undisturbed by these events. The ancient
Hindoos were calm, contemplative dreamers, a nation of
philosophers, who could only conceive of disputes in themselves,
in their own thoughts; the transcendental nature
of the atmosphere in which his ideas worked, and in which
the Hindoo lived, could not fail to retard the development
of practical, social, and political virtues, and the appreciation
of the beautiful and useful. The Hindoo saw nothing in
the past but the mystery of the Creation, in the future but
the mystery of his destiny; the present offered nothing to
him that could awaken physical activity, and apparently
had no reality for him; no people ever existed who
believed more firmly in a future life, or who occupied
themselves less with this one; such as they were in the
beginning, such they remained. The only sphere in which
the Indian mind moves freely is the sphere of religion and
that of philosophy. In no other part of the world have
metaphysical ideas taken such deep root as in India; the
forms in which these ideas were clothed, in epochs of varying
culture, and in the midst of divers classes of society,
were alternately those of the grossest superstition and of
the most exalted spiritualism.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that in these two Aryan branches
must we look for our ancestors. How shall we verify the
truth of this assertion? What family likeness must we<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
seek in order to recognise the relationship? How feel certain
that the languages we speak have been derived from
them? “If we knew nothing of the existence of Latin&mdash;if
no historical documents existed to tell us of the
Roman empire&mdash;a mere comparison of the six Romance
dialects would enable us to say that at some time there
must have been a language from which all these modern
dialects derived their origin in common.”<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Let us conjugate the verb <em>to be</em> in Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, French, Walachian, and in Rhætian, and we
shall see that it is clear: first, that all are but varieties of
one common type: secondly, that it is impossible to consider
any one of these six dialects as the original from
which the others had been borrowed, since no single one
contains the elements composing them. “If we find such
forms as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">j’ai aimé</i>, we can explain them by a mere reference
to the grammatical materials which French has still
at its command, and the same may be said of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">j’aimerai</i>,
i.e. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je-aimer-ai</i>, I have to love, I shall love. But a
change from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je suis</i> to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu es</i> is inexplicable by the light
of French grammar; it must have been a part of some
language antecedent to any of the Romance dialects; it is,
in fact, the verb <em>to be</em> in Latin, which solves this difficulty;
each of the six paradigms is but a metamorphosis of the
Latin.”<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It was known that the roots were the same in all the
Aryan languages, that the same grammatical changes were
common in many of the words in everyday use, such as
father, mother, heaven, sun, moon, horse, and cow, as well
as in the principal numbers; but it was the study of
Sanscrit in its primitive form which first led the learned
to the discovery of the reason of the vowel changes in
certain words in use in our day, and which changes the
English word <em>to wit</em>, to know, into <em>I wot</em>, I know, and the<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ich weise</i> into <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wir wissen</i>; these changes are
the result of a general law, the application of which can
nowhere be more clearly appreciated than in the Vedic
Sanscrit, and which was unknown until this language was
studied in the Veda. (I will here note that Sanscrit not
being the original from which the other Aryan dialects
have their being, but an elder brother, when Max Müller
makes use of a Sanscrit phrase he does it to give an idea
of the process through which the language has passed which
he considers preceded Sanscrit.)</p>

<p>There is another list of paradigms which, under a less
familiar aspect than the first, presents the same phenomenon.
Conjugate the verb <em>to be</em> in Doric, Latin, old
Slav, Sanscrit, Celtic, Lithuanian, Zend, Gothic, and
Armenian, and you will see that the nine are varieties of
one common type, and that it is impossible to consider
any one of them as the original of the others, since, here
again, none of the languages possess the grammatical
material out of which these forms could have been framed.
Sanscrit cannot have been the source from which the rest
were derived, since Greek, in several instances, has retained
a more organic form than the Sanscrit. Nor can Greek
be considered as the earliest language from which the
others were derived, for not even Latin could be called
the daughter of Greek, since Latin has preserved certain
forms more primitive than the Greek. Hence all these
nine dialects point to some more ancient language, which
was to them what Latin was to the Romance dialects;
only at that early period there was no literature to preserve
to us any remnant of that mother-tongue that died
in giving birth to all the modern Aryan dialects.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>There is one fact to be noted. If a comparison be
made of the verb <em>to be</em> in these dialects, it will be seen
that Sanscrit is no more distinct from the Greek of Homer,
or from the Gothic of Ulfilas, or from the Anglo-Saxon of<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
Alfred, than the Romance dialects from each other; that,
in fact, the resemblance is more striking between Sanscrit
and Lithuanian, and between Sanscrit and Russian, than
between French and Italian. This circumstance proves
that all the essential grammatical forms of these languages
had been fully framed and established before the first
separation of the Aryan family took place, that is to say,
at a time before there were any Grecians to speak Greek,
or any Brahmans to invoke God’s name in Sanscrit.</p>

<p>The science of comparative philology enables us to have
glimpses of the social condition of our Aryan ancestors
before they left their first abode. All historical documents
of this period are lacking, for the simple reason that the
time of which we are speaking is anterior to any historical
records; “but comparative philology has placed in our
hands a telescope of such power that where formerly we
could see but nebulous clouds we now discover distinct
forms and outlines.”<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>We see that our ancestors were no savages, but agricultural
nomads, that they laboured, made roads, possessed
the art of weaving and sewing; they built towns, kept
domestic animals, lived under a kingly government, and
counted at least up to one hundred. We learn this not
only from the words father, mother, son, daughter, heaven,
earth, but also from house, town, king, dog, cow, hatchet,
and many others, which are found to be the same in the
German, Celtic, Slavonic, Greek, Latin, and Sanscrit.
They are the same because they all point to some more
ancient language, the mother-tongue in use before the
separation of the various Aryan tribes. From this period
the other words also date, expressing all the degrees of
relationship, even those by alliance, thus giving clear proof
of the early organisation of family life.</p>

<p>At the same time a decimal system of numeration
also existed, the numbers from one to a hundred, “in itself<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
one of the most marvellous achievements of the human
mind, produced from an abstract conception of quantity,
regulated by a spirit of philosophical classification, and
yet conceived, matured and finished before the soil of
Europe was trodden by Greek, Roman, Slav, or Teuton.
Such a system could only have been formed by a very
small community, in which by the help of a tacit agreement,
each number could only bear one signification. If
we were suddenly obliged to invent new names for one,
two and three we should quickly feel the great difficulty
of the task; to supply new names for material objects
would be comparatively easy, as these have different
attributes which could be used in their designation; we
could call the sea, the salt water; and the rain, the water
of heaven; numbers are, however, such abstract conceptions
that it would be foolish to attempt to find in them
palpable attributes, and thus give expression to a merely
quantitative idea.”<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Since the names of the Aryan numbers up to one
hundred are the same, it proves that they date from a
time when our ancestors lived under circumscribed conditions
united by common ties. This is not so with the
word <em>thousand</em>; the names for <em>thousand</em> differ in German
and Slavonic, because they have their rise after the dispersion
of the race. Sanscrit and Zend share the name
for thousand, which proves the union of the ancestors of
the Brahmans and Zoroastrians&mdash;after their exodus&mdash;by
the ties of a common language.</p>

<p>In this way the facts of language&mdash;which are so simple
that a child could seize them&mdash;enable us to travel from
the known to the unknown, and prove our descent from
the once small family of the Aryas.</p>

<p>Man in the abstract has been studied for long years.
Max Müller contemplates this abstraction in the Aryan
man; this has not previously been attempted. Certainly<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
we Aryans of to-day differ greatly from our first parents,
but not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</i>; the ties which connect us have not
been severed, and he it is&mdash;our Aryan ancestor&mdash;who will
help us to understand how we are verily the children of
our fathers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Ref_51">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is possible to distinguish in ourselves four things:
sensation, perception, conception, and the signs by means
of which we designate objects, that is their names; these
enable us to separate the one from the other. We must
not imagine that these four exist as separate entities, “no
words are possible without concepts, no concepts without
percepts, no percepts without sensations.”<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;<cite>Science of
Thought</cite>, p. 2.</p>

<p>These four constituent elements of thought are merely
four different phases in the growth of what we call our
mind.</p>

<p>I employ these terms because they are in use in philosophical
language; there are also many others constantly
on the lips of philosophers, some of them newly coined.
This is greatly to be regretted, as much of our confusion
of thought arises from this superabundance of philosophical
terms. If such words as impression, sensation, perception,
intuition, presentation, conception, soul, reason, and many
others could for a time be banished from our philosophical
dictionaries, and some only readmitted after they had
undergone a thorough purification and were made to
return to their primitive signification, an immense service
would have been rendered to mental science; as every
writer defines them as he will, or uses them without
definition; and he seems to imagine that because there<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
are so many words, there must also be so many variations,
“Because in the German language there are two words:
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verstand</i> and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vernunft</i>, both originally expressing the
same thing, the greatest efforts have been made to show
that there is something to be called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verstand</i>, totally
different from what is called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vernunft</i>; and as there is a
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vernunft</i> by the side of a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verstand</i> in German, English
philosophers have been most anxious to introduce the
same distinction between understanding and reason into
English”;<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and “because we have a name for impression,
and another for sensations, we are led to imagine that impressions
do actually exist by the side of sensations. But
what was originally meant by impression was not something
beside sensation, but rather one side of sensation,
namely, the passive side, which may be spoken of by itself,
but which in every real sensation is inseparable from its
active side.”<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>All the various shades and developments of sensation
were doubtless distinguished and named for some very
useful purpose; but the inconvenience was great when
the terms became too numerous. “We may safely enjoy
the wealth of language accumulated by a long line of
thinkers, if only we take care not to accept a coin for more
or less than it is really worth. We must weigh our words
as the ancients often weighed their coins, and not be deceived
by their current value.”<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> When we have bravely
resolved to throw away superfluous words, we need not
imagine that we are the poorer, since we have only lost
what we, in reality, never possessed. So powerful, however,
is the action of words on thoughts, that as soon as
we throw away a word, we feel ourselves to have been
robbed of the thing itself; the sun rises just the same,
though we say now that it does not rise. Those things
which we call mind, intellect, reason, memory, in fact the<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
soul, have no existence as such&mdash;that is apart from ourselves.
This assertion may sound very terrible to those
philosophers who imagine that the dignity of man consists
in the possession of these and other powers; at last there
arises a complete mythology, a philosophic polytheism,
when these are spoken of as distinct possessions, independent
powers, with limits not very sharply defined; and
however orthodox that polytheism has become, it is never
too late to protest against it. In making use of these
terms it should be understood that they represent certain
modes of action and phases of the Ego.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that our modern languages have
nothing to replace the word “mind,” such as there is in
the Sanscrit language, meaning “working within.” As
soon as we speak of <em>mind</em> we cannot help thinking of an
independent something dwelling in our body, whereas by
mind I mean nothing but that working which is going on
within, embracing sensation, perception, conception, and
naming, and the worker who accomplishes this is the
Ego.</p>

<p>Thus the Ego means nothing but consciousness of itself.</p>

<p>There is one word which it would be desirable to reintroduce
into our philosophical phraseology and that is
Logos; it means the word and the thought combined.
Logos is a single intellectual act under two aspects; it is
an untranslatable word. We were told at school that it
was strange that the Greeks should not have distinguished
between Logos Speech and Logos Reason, and it was represented
as a progress toward clearer thought that later
writers should have distinguished between Logos the spoken
word and Logos the inner thought.</p>

<p>But the Greeks were right: no doubt it may be an
advantage to be able to distinguish between two sides of
the same thing, but that advantage is more than neutralised
if such distinction leads us to suppose that these two
sides are two different things. Let us avoid the very<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
common error that things which can be distinguished can
therefore claim an independent existence; we can distinguish
between an orange and its peel, but no orange can
grow without peel, nor peel without the fruit.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that I am such a bigoted upholder
of the unity of the Ego as to wish to see all these
names banished from our philosophical dictionaries. Let
us use the word Sense when speaking of the Ego as perceiving.
Let us use Intellect when the Ego is simply
conceiving; and the word language when it is speaking;
let us even use the word <em>memory</em> when we wish to speak
of the partial permanence of the work done by sensation,
perception, and conception; and let us use Reason or
Reasoning for the process which produces what the logicians
call propositions and syllogisms; but let us never forget
that neither to remember nor to reason implies the possession
of a thing called reason or memory. All our mental
life will remain just the same though we deny the existence
of the terms which obscure our vision; let us hold
fast to the existence of the Ego, it exists in its entity, it
only is the worker, and it receives its highest expression in
the Logos.</p>

<p>This truth, that thought and language are inseparable,
that thought without language is as impossible as language
without thought has only recently been affirmed by comparative
philologists. Many learned writers are still
unwilling to admit that ideas without words are impossible
though at the same time they are quite willing to concede
that words are impossible without concepts.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>We possess an immense number of books on logic, yet
we are met everywhere by the same vagueness on this
subject. John Stuart Mill speaks of language as one of
the principal elements or helps of thought, but he never
mentions any other instruments. This lack is probably
owing to the unfortunate influence of modern languages<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
which have two words, the one for language, the other
for thought; this gives the impression that there is a
substantial instead of an apparent difference between the
two; it is also owing to the dislike of philosophers to
allow that all which is most lofty, most spiritual in us
should be dependent on such miserable crutches as words
are supposed to be. Yet it is evident that we cannot
advance one step towards philosophy without acknowledging
the fact that we think in words and words only. This
thought would be less difficult to grasp if we defined
clearly what are thoughts. Sensation, pain, pleasure,
dreaming, or willing cannot be called true thought, but
variations of inward activity; in the same way as shrieks,
howls, or even the sounds of real words, taken from a
foreign language, are no more language than our emotions
are thoughts. The word Logos expresses this, since it had
originally the two meanings of gathering and combining,
and so became the proper name of all that we call reason;
but as it also means language, it tells us that the process
of gathering and combining, which begins with sensation
and passes on to perception and conception, reaches its full
perfection only when the inward activity takes form in the
Logos or speech.</p>

<p>Language therefore is not as has been often imagined,
thought plus sound; but thought is really language minus
sound; words are the external symbols of thought, sounding
symbols when we articulate in a loud voice, but mute
when we confine ourselves to merely thinking them, since
it is a fact that we think in words, and it is not possible
to think otherwise. The possession of a language is shown
even in the tracing of whole sentences by ideographic
signs, which need not be pronounced at all, or as in the
astronomical signs in our almanacks which may be pronounced
differently in different languages: or we may
substitute algebraic signs for words; we could as well calculate
without numbers as apply our reason without words<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
I have freely and fully admitted that thoughts may exist
without words, because other signs may take the place of
words between persons speaking different languages possibly
between deaf and dumb people. Five fingers held up are
quite sufficient to convey the concept of five, thus the
hand may become the sign for five, both hands for ten,
hands and feet for twenty. In America and Australia
where many dialects are spoken this method has attained
a great degree of perfection, but we notice that in all cases
under review each one thinks in his own language and
then translates his thought into pantomime.</p>

<p>A final fact adduced against the theory that it is impossible
to think without language, which was very popular,
is that deaf and dumb people cannot speak, and yet can
think; this argument has no great value, as it is now
averred that “a man born dumb who had always lived
among deaf and dumb people, and had not been taught to
express thoughts by signs would be capable of few higher
intellectual manifestations than a monkey or an elephant;
and this in spite of the fact that no naturalist could distinguish
any difference between the size of their brains and
those belonging to men who could speak.” For deaf
mutes to be able to think and reason, they must have
learned from those who use words, then only can they
substitute other signs for their words and concepts. Still
Professor Huxley accords to these unfortunate men certain
intellectual heritages derived from their parents.</p>

<p>These are some of the chief points in the science of
language. The fundamental law which this science lays
down of the unity of thought and speech is a torch which
may throw light on the origin of man.</p>

<p>Whilst philosophers and moralists have studied men,
and naturalists animals, Darwin considered it necessary to
collect information concerning both men and beasts simultaneously
before making a biography of the human being.
With the modesty so often characteristic of a great genius,
the English naturalist acknowledges that “many of the
views which have been advanced are highly speculative,
and some no doubt will prove erroneous. False facts are
highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often
long endure; but false views, if supported by some evidence,
do little harm, as everyone takes a salutary pleasure in
proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path
towards error is closed and the road to truth is often at
the same time opened.”<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Although there is no doubt that the facts observed by
Darwin and recorded in the <cite>Origin of Species</cite>, are perfectly
correct, I hope to be able to dispose of the opinion
that “man and animals follow parallel lines in their lives,
but that man advances more quickly, and has taken his
place in the front rank.”</p>

<p>Whilst making a short <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of remarks which Noiré
and other learned writers have made on animals, I also
propose to draw a comparison between the two who are
so closely connected&mdash;the superior and inferior animal.</p>

<p>Darwin was not alone in his endeavour to prove that
there exists no essential difference between man and beast;
some have even asserted that the intelligence of certain<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
animals is not only equal to, but at times, superior to
that of man. We must be on our guard, however, against
those numerous anecdotes which have led even philosophers
astray; we will also divest our minds of prejudice and
preconceived notions, that we may introduce some order
into ideas which have been disturbed by superficial
observers and the makers of false systems, those enemies
of true science; let us candidly own the smallness of our
knowledge concerning the mind of an animal; we do not
in the least know how they philosophise, nor how an ox
recognises his stable door. Instead of having recourse to
animals and seeking to draw parallels between their mental
faculties and ours, let us examine ourselves to find out
what passes in our own minds. We shall then discover
that we never in reality perceive anything unless we can
distinguish it from other things by means, if not of a
word, yet of a sign; that is till we have passed through
the four stages of sensation, perception, conception, and
more important than all, for our present purpose, of
naming. When it is once acknowledged that concepts
are impossible without words, and that man alone amongst
organised beings possesses the power of language, and that
the mental faculties of animals are different from ours in
kind, and not only in degree, it naturally follows that a
genealogical descent of man from animals is an impossible
assumption.</p>

<p>Formerly, in comparing the characteristics of man and
animals it was contended that the latter were ruled by
instinct in place of the reason which was the attribute of
the former; and although an affirmation is not an explanation
it appeared sufficiently plausible and was accepted.
But the fact is that both man and beast possess instinct.
If the spider weaves his net by instinct, a child takes his
mother’s breast also by instinct; both are with regard to
instinct at one level. Man involuntarily extends his arm
to protect himself if he suddenly perceives an object near<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
him on the point of striking him. “If we tear a spider’s
web, and watch the spider first run from it in despair,
then return and examine the mischief and endeavour to
mend it. Surely we have the instinct of weaving controlled
by observation, by comparison, by reflection, and
by judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>No one has hitherto succeeded in explaining and
analysing the instinct said to be in animals. Cuvier<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and other naturalists have compared it with habit.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This
comparison gives an accurate notion of the frame of mind
under which an instinctive action is performed, but does
not necessarily explain its origin.</p>

<p>As reason develops in man, instinct plays a less important
part; whereas a cat chases a mouse, a bird flies,
and fish swim by instinct from their birth to their last
day; and the actions of ants, bees, and moles, do not cease
to amaze us, because they are inseparable from their
structure and their vital functions. The natural impulses
which guide birds and insects in making their nests, hives,
and storehouses, cocoons of silk with which they have so
enriched our world and theirs, are the results of constant
and repeated acts, during the course of innumerable generations.
The fact of not distinguishing the instinct which
is in man from that found in animals and thus attributing
man’s conscious acts to the natural leanings which guide
unconscious creatures, has perhaps caused Renan to assert
that the monotheistic tendency of the Semitic race belongs
to it by a religious instinct.</p>

<p>It is certain that impressions are received both by man
and by animals; with both the knowledge of objects
proceeds from the impressions made on the senses, thus<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
transmitting the image to the intelligence; but there the
likeness ends; the capacities differ. The animal remains
the slave&mdash;in every sense of the word&mdash;of his organs; the
sight of a bone to gnaw, the corner in which he lies, the
signs of friendship that he receives from human beings,
call forth in a dog a chain of feelings taking the place of
the chain of ideas called out in man.</p>

<p>Man’s capabilities of introducing intermediaries between
the intention and the fulfilment of his object witness to
his wideness of mind, his experience of the past and prevision
of the future; all those things that he owes to his
power of imagination and conception even in the case of
things having no real existence, or which do not exist as
yet; he reproduces at will the outward likeness of what
is not at the moment before him. Thus man who names
an object, <em>thinks</em> it; but the animal from not possessing
language cannot <em>think</em> it and cannot reproduce it when
out of its sight.</p>

<p>The use or non-use of tools creates a great gulf between
man and the brutes. The most intelligent animal, a
monkey of a high order, never uses a tool&mdash;even the most
primitive&mdash;to accomplish his will; no one can ascribe to
the animal creative actions, that is, it does not fashion an
implement that it may attain another end; it has never
been known to carry an object from one spot to another
that it might act as a ladder to bring the animal nearer
to the fruit it desired to reach.</p>

<p>But this concession, I think, we may make to Darwin;
that even in the sphere of mental activities we can never
entirely separate ourselves from the brute creation. We
experience in ourselves a certain condition of mind, where
fancies alternate with passing agitation; these proceed from
intense, but confused emotions. This condition does not
allow of clear explanation even to ourselves, since it has
nothing in common with true thought, which is inseparable
from the consciousness of objects, and therefore is lacking<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
in words with which to express itself. To Mendelssohn
this mental condition was perfectly known, and he says,
“It is exactly at that moment when language is impotent
to express the experiences of the soul, that the sphere of
music opens to us; if all that passes in us were capable
of being expressed in words, I should write no more music.”</p>

<p>A flock of birds about to migrate, all follow an unanimous
impulse in uttering at starting a few high clear notes,
perhaps impelled by an unknown motive, their inclinations
and wills find collective expression therein, by a mutual
impulse which comes from soundless depths of the life of
the senses, carrying all before it. This universal sympathy,
however difficult to explain, is one of the noblest possessions
of the inferior animals; even the aptitude they
display for certain mechanical acts of labour does not
stand on the same level; but in the vocal manifestations
of birds there is no indication of true thought, the basis
of real language.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now come, my dog, for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>. It would be
impossible to hold converse with ants, bees, monkeys,
moles, or birds, as I should not acknowledge them as my
compeers, I should not admit them as intimates; but you
I know well; and, let me tell you, your judges have
shown their impartiality towards you; none of the vices
which degrade us&mdash;your superiors&mdash;have been laid to
your account. You are called neither gourmand, thief,
idler, nor hypocrite; but you lack the qualities that
might have been yours had you possessed the faculty of
combination. They say that you create nothing because
you fail to see what purpose tools may serve; and you
are ignorant of the fact that <em>A.</em> being given, <em>B.</em> must
follow&mdash;such is combination. Still, on looking closely, it
is possible to discover amongst us&mdash;your superiors&mdash;those
who are stupid&mdash;or awkward&mdash;who take small advantage
of all the means put within their reach to recede from a<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
false position, to recover from the effects of a wrong step,
or, what is still more important, remedy their ignorance.
Yes, there are many such, and these also lack the faculty
of combination.</p>

<p>Your judges also assert that from the want on your
part of being able to attach one idea to another, you do
not think of your master when he is absent from you.
What ingratitude! But I wonder whether those friends,
who profess so much pleasure in my company, think of
me when I am absent; perhaps no more than you do.</p>

<p>Let me continue my enquiries for a few minutes. We
will suppose that we two are in my study. I am occupied
with a book, and am not thinking of you at all. You are
stretched at my feet with your nose between your paws,
watching a fly near you. I make a sudden movement,
you look at me, and at the same moment wag your tail....
Am I to suppose that you wag it to hide your dislike to
me? The noble quality which I and all your superiors
possess is lacking in you; you have no speech for thought
in which to tell me your love for me; but if you could
speak, that is, were like one of ourselves, would you be as
truthful as you are now, being only a dog that has
nothing but his tail with which to make his master
understand his feelings towards him? Schopenhauer ...
but you know nothing of Schopenhauer, if you could speak
I should teach you to read, and then you would know him.
Schopenhauer is a great and learned philosopher, who says,
“How much this movement of the tail surpasses in
sincerity many other assurances of friendship and devotion.”<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>This is a long digression on Darwin’s idea that man
and animals lead parallel lives, but that the one progresses
quickly, the other slowly. I think I have shown that it
is not a question of rapidity or tardiness of progress, but
rather whether both travellers are equally well equipped
with the means of passing the Rubicon.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PRIMITIVE HUMANITY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Some courage is required to attack the subject of comparative
philology as treated by certain learned authors;
they are bold enough to seek to transport themselves to
an age of such remote antiquity that history is silent on
the subject, but in which a nascent humanity endeavoured
to find expression for its sensations in a language which
probably had no name.</p>

<p>When my attention was first attracted to the work of
this school, so long as my mind was content to skim over
the surface of an unknown world, so immeasurably distant
from us, and whilst flitting too rapidly over it to be able
to distinguish any of its features, it presented itself to me
as a creation of my heated imagination. Since then I
have lived in that world of wonders, and I then grasped
the fact that it was quite possible for this world to have
been a reality. But to journey thither, even to live in
this strange country, the only path to which is by
induction, in company with Max Müller and Noiré, who,
apparently, are its inhabitants, from the ease with
which they move in it, is a totally different matter
from explaining the methods of getting there, or describing
the sojourn. I should have to draw information from
various sources, and the scientific and hypothetical data
connected therewith would require sorting and rearranging
to make them assimilate more easily; these would present
difficulties not readily surmounted.</p>

<p>How could a reasonable and speaking being come forth
from that which had no reason and no language?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>The earliest traditions are silent on the manner of man’s
acquisition of his first ideas and his first words. But
because a problem has not been solved, that is no reason
for the assertion that it is insoluble, unless a refutation is
at once demonstrable, as in the squaring of the circle.
“If every one had abstained from striving to penetrate
hidden things, no sciences would exist,” Noiré remarked.
Newton might have said: “The facts that a stone falls
and the planets move are known by actual experience,
why search out the laws which produce these phenomena?”
And the theory of gravitation would have been lacking.
Lyell might have said: “We see that the crust of the
earth is composed of several strata, why reckon the time
required for their formation?” And there would have
been no science of geology. Liebig might have said:
“We see that clover grows and cattle prosper, why should
the relation of cause and effect concern us?” And there
would have been no organic chemistry. Adam Smith
might have said: “We know by experience that valuable
objects can be exchanged, and that their prices fluctuate,
why should we study the cause of rise and fall?” And
this chapter would have been missing from political
economy.</p>

<p>No road presents itself to me by which to arrive in the
midst of primitive humanity; of necessity, therefore, I
have recourse to analogy, which, under the circumstances,
is not the worst expedient.</p>

<p>When the Romans first encountered Germans, they
were chiefly struck by the great stature, the blue eyes,
and the light hair of this inimical race. Tacitus, in
alluding to this fact, says that each German exactly
resembled his fellow. Although we are familiar with the
external appearance of various nations, yet if we found
ourselves in the presence of a large number of negroes we
should experience an analogous sensation, only by degrees
should we distinguish one from the other. In an<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
intensified degree primitive man must have had similar
experiences when, first finding himself in a world of which
he knew nothing, and of which he understood nothing,
the consciousness of what he saw around him was making
itself apparent. These early races learnt the meaning
of the details of surrounding nature but slowly; their
eyes followed the brilliant circle as it moved from one
quarter of the heavens to the other; they noticed the fire
which came whence they knew not; they heard the crash
of thunder, reproduced by the echoes in the mountains
synchronising with the devastations caused by the storm.
If one man alone had witnessed these terrifying effects in
nature, his reason would have tottered from fear; the
stones and the herbs of the field could not share his
agitation; the death of a man from terror would leave
them unmoved. Happily man was not alone, all those
around him shared his agitation, and the terror manifested
itself on each by signs which each would understand
instinctively. This period of semi-consciousness before
the full awakening might have been a prolonged one,
but physical sensations and necessities multiplied themselves,
and were very various and imperative; action was
indispensable if privations were to be avoided; and instinct
came to their aid. The need of guarding themselves
from the burning rays of the sun caused them to provide
shelters by interlacing branches of trees; to protect
themselves from cold they took the skins of wild beasts
to throw over their shoulders; where natural caverns
were insufficient for their wants they made themselves
refuges in the sides of the mountains; they were forced
to light and maintain fires; sharpen stones either for tools
or for weapons of defence; the wants of one were the
wants of all, and all gave themselves to the task of
satisfying them. It is so evident that primitive activity
must have been co-operative, that it outrages common
sense to picture each man labouring by himself for himself<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
alone. The mental phenomenon known as <em>intention</em>,
was the common property of all; the mutual sympathy
played the part of the electric current of our laboratories,
and the inarticulate sounds escaping involuntarily from
the lips of each worker, served as a means of communication.</p>

<p>In order the better to understand the function of the
voice in the education of primitive man, let us look
around us and listen. Whenever our senses are excited,
and our muscles hard at work, we feel a kind of relief in
uttering sounds which in themselves have no meaning.
“They are a relief rather than an effort, a moderation or
modulation of the quickened breath in its escape through
the mouth.”<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>When men work together, on account of the nature
of the task requiring united effort, they are naturally
inclined to accompany their occupations with certain
more or less rhythmical utterances, which react beneficially
on the inward disturbance caused by muscular effort.
When a body of men march, row, or wield hammers, they
do not keep silence; formerly soldiers sang as they
marched to battle; our modern civilisation only caused
the substitution of fife and drums for the songs; and our
soldiers do not readily abandon these measured accompaniments,
which make them less susceptible of fatigue.
When savage races dance they make the air resound with
measured cadences; our peasants sing while joining in the
country dances; the custom of singing during work is
more marked amongst those who belong to the races
which are less under the influence of civilisation, and are
more entirely absorbed by their manual occupation, and
with whom personal preoccupation has small hold.</p>

<p>These inarticulate sounds which Noiré has named
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamor concomitans</i> and Max Müller <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamor significans</i>,
uttered by primitive men when working in concert, and<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
always inseparable from acts, could be differentiated in
accordance with the acts performed; and at a period
when actual speech did not yet exist, they would always
have this practical value, they would awaken the remembrance
of acts performed in the past, and be repeated in
the present, they would thus be instantly understood by
all, and readily retained by the memory. But what was
there to determine the application of certain sounds to
certain occupations? This has not been made clear. Plato,
Socrates, and others, have considered that the origin of
language might be traced to the imitation of the sounds of
nature, and have sought for a resemblance between these
sounds and certain letters of the alphabet, but even were
it possible here and there to discover a faint analogy, our
efforts would only end in contradictions. There seems to
be neither necessity nor absolute freedom in the choice of
the sounds expressive of these acts, but rather the result
of some accident, or of causes of which we are ignorant.
In any case these sounds were merely the materials of
which language was built.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that nothing would penetrate
more deeply into man’s consciousness, or produce
mutual understanding more readily, than acts undertaken
and accomplished with the same end in view by a number
of men united in a common impulse. During the digging
of the caves, the weaving of the nets, the thrashing of the
grain, the workers would follow with their eyes the gradual
transformation perceptible in these activities, and the
sounds which they emitted, or the half-formed words
issuing from their lips would be modified or softened at
each development in the work; these developments
becoming more and more distinct, more and more impressed
with their own special characteristic. The idea
of individuality must have been very clouded, very
confused amongst primitive man; that which one saw the
other saw after the same manner; they designed each<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
object in creating it; in this way the world became as a
book to them, this book, the result of their combined
labour, they learnt to read fluently by means of these
sounds and words which increased as they varied. Thus
work&mdash;man’s good genius&mdash;is proved to be the source of
what is truly human, viz., reason and language.</p>

<p>Here I will note a curious fact and one which is historical.
At a period when writing was unknown in India,
the Brahmans had already established the rules of poetical
metre, which were originally connected with dancing and
music. These rules had been preserved in the Veda. The
various Sanscrit names for metre are a witness of the
union of corporal and phonetic movements. The root of
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khandas</i>, metre, is the same as the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandere</i> in
the sense of stepping; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vritta</i>, metre, from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vrit</i>, verto&mdash;to
turn, meant originally the last three or four steps of a
dancing movement, the turn, the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">versus</i>, which determined
the whole character of dance or of the metre. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Trishtubh</i>,
the name of a common metre in the Veda, meant three-step,
because its turn&mdash;its <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vritta</i> or <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">versus</i>&mdash;consisted of
three steps, ∪ - -. Thus the innate necessity that man
feels of linking the play of the vocal chords to the movement
of hands or feet, had been controlled by fixed laws,
twenty-four centuries ago, by the Hindoo grammarians;
and the most recent theories of modern writers on the
subject attest the excellence of these laws. The assertion
that it is natural to peasants not to keep silence when
working is of very ancient date, but Noiré was the first to
deduce scientific data from the fact.</p>

<p>The study of Sanscrit has shown us that two thousand
years ago it occurred to Hindoo grammarians to investigate
the origin of the words of their language, when they
discovered that all words could be reduced to roots, and
that these roots all expressed various forms of activity;
that they were therefore verbs, and that the number of
these roots was very restricted. Our present philologists<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
have continued this work and are not only able to acknowledge
the accuracy of the Brahmanic discovery, but also
to certify that the grammatical analysis of the Hindoos,
put forth 500 years before our era, has never been
surpassed. It is important to remember that roots are
the fundamental elements which permeate the whole
organism of the language. Hebrew has been reduced
by Renan and other Hebraists to about 500 roots; the
work has still to be done for the whole Semitic family.
The same process has been carried out with regard to the
Aryan languages; we find the number of roots in Sanscrit
reduced to about 800; of Gothic about 600; rather more
than 400 in the Teutonic family, and 600 in the Slavic.
The Ural-Altaic languages have also undergone a partial
analysis of the same kind, and the result at present corresponds
to that obtained by the examination of the other
families. After eliminating the tertiary and secondary
roots from the Sanscrit the residuum is 600 or 500, and
we arrive at the fact that this entire language, and, in a
great measure, all the Aryan languages, can be traced back
to an extremely small number of roots.</p>

<p>As the Hindoo grammarians asserted that all roots
contain the representation of various forms of activity,
it behoved our philologists to investigate this and discover
their meaning. Professor Noiré thought that the consciousness
that men had of their own acts must have
formed the origin of the primitive concepts of the human
mind, and found expression in signs or words. Max
Müller shows us<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that all the Sanscrit roots express a
concept or consciousness of the repeated acts, the acts with
which man in his infancy would be most familiar. But it
must be noted that the concepts or signs are not of single
acts, but the realisation of repeated acts; to dig was not
to put a spade into the ground once, it is the action of
digging continuously; to sharpen was not to pass one<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
flint over another once, it was the continual action of
sharpening. The consciousness of accomplishing these
repeated acts as if one act, became the first germ of
conceptual thought. During this initial phase of
thought, when the first consciousness of his own repeated
acts awoke in man and assumed a conceptual character,
will, act and knowledge were as yet one and undivided,
and the whole of his conscious knowledge was subjective,
exclusively concerned with his own voluntary act. We
possess the genealogy of a large number of Aryan roots,
and we find on examination that the activity which formed
their basis was at the beginning always a creative activity,
since it called into life conceptions which up to that time
had not existed.</p>

<p>Nothing is more interesting than researches into the
origin of the growth of human thought, when carried out
not according to the systems of certain philologists of our
day, but historically, after the fashion of the Indian
trapper, who notes on the sand every imprint of the footsteps
of him whom he pursues.</p>

<p>For the present I will content myself by bringing
forward in illustration three primary roots. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vê</i> (<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vâ</i>),
which is, to weave; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mar</i>, to crush; and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan</i>, to dig.
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vê</i> (<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vâ</i>), <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mar</i>, and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan</i> are thus verbs.</p>

<p>When we now picture the four acts of weaving, spinning,
sewing, and knitting, they appear so to differ the one from
the other, that it seems impossible to consider them other
than four distinct acts, and difficult to believe that there
is one common origin to all. These four processes, however,
all had their germ in the one primitive act of interlacing
the boughs of trees to form a hedge or roof. This
root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vê</i> (<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Vâ</i>) had an immense number of offshoots; from
the acts of interlacing and platting came the conception
of binding, in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vieo</i>, to twist, to divide; in German,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">winden</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">wickeln</i>; the Latin words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitis</i>, a vine; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vimen</i>,
osier, a twig; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viburnum</i>, a climbing plant; the Slavic word<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
<i lang="sk" xml:lang="sk">vetla</i>, willow; the Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vetra</i>, reed, rush; the German
word for rush, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">binse</i>, is connected with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">binden</i>, to join,
and the secondary meaning of ties of relationship and
alliance: again, in the Old High-German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nothbendig</i>,
or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nothwendigkeit</i>, bound, straitened, and the Gothic
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">naudibandi</i>, tie, chain. All these words, whether in the
Roman, German, or Slavonic dialects, have retained the
root <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vê</i> (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vâ</i>), so that it is impossible not to recognise the
trunk of which these are the branches. Thus a large
number of apparently dissimilar images became entangled
the one with the other, and in proportion as we approach
their starting-point do we find them discarding their own
special signification, and becoming absorbed in the single
conception of weaving and platting.</p>

<p>The root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mar</i>, to grind, has also the meaning of to
crush, to powder, to rub down, etc., and whether we look
at the Latin, Greek, Celtic, German, or Slav, the words
representing the verb <em>to mill</em>, and the name <em>mill</em> come
thence; the transition from <em>milling</em> to <em>fighting</em> is natural;
thus Homer used the word <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mar-na-mai</i>, I fight, I pound.
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mar</i> produced in Latin the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mordeo</i>, I bite; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morior</i>
(originally, to decay), I die; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mortuus</i>, dead; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors</i>, death;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morbus</i>, illness; in Greek, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">marasmos</i>, decay; rendered in
German by <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sich aufreiben</i>, to become exhausted. In
Sanscrit we must remember that the consonants <em>r</em> and <em>l</em>
are cognate and interchangeable; thus, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mar</i> = <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mal</i>; and
that <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ar</i> in Sanscrit is shortened, and the vowel modified
and pronounced <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ri</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mar</i> = <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mri</i>; that <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ar</i> may be pronounced
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ra</i>, and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">al</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">la</i>; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mar</i> = <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mra</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mal</i> = <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mla</i>: thus
in Sanscrit we find <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mrita</i>, dead; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mritya</i>, death, and
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mriye</i>, I die. One of the earliest names for man was
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">marta</i>, the dying; the equivalent in Greek for the
Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mra</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mla</i> is <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mbro</i>, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mblo</i>; and after dropping
the <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">m</i> becomes <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">bro</i> and <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">blo</i>; <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">brotos</i>, mortal. Having
chosen this name for himself, man gave the opposite name
to the gods; he called them <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ambrotoi</i>, without decay,<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
immortal; and their food <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ambrosia</i>, immortality. An
offshoot of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mar</i> is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mard</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mrg</i>; thence <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mradati</i>,
rubbing down, pulverising, grind to powder; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mrid</i> is in
Sanscrit the word for dust, and afterwards was used for
soil in general or earth; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mrid</i>, to weaken, to soften, to
melt; thus, fluid mass. This idea in English takes the
form <em>malt</em>, grain soaked and softened; then the Greek
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">meldo</i>, and the Gothic <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mulda</i>, soft ground or morass, and
that which is softened by use or the action of time. The
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordes</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordidus</i> are connected herewith, as the
same root may be found in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">smarna</i>, Gothic, and the
Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mélas</i> and <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">moros</i>, black, and in <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">murus</i>, brown-black;
in the Russian <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">smola</i>, wax and resin. “Colour
was conceived originally as the result of the act of covering
or extending a fluid over a surface; it was not till the art
of painting, in its most primitive form, was discovered and
named, that there could have been a name for colour.”<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The name of colour in Sanscrit is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">varna</i>, from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">var</i>, to
cover. The idea conveyed by the words, to smooth, to
flatter, to soften, to mollify, to melt a hard substance, to
polish a rough surface by constant rubbing, led to the
same terms being used for expressing the softening
influence which man exercised on man, by looks, gestures,
words or prayers, and these expressions were especially
used by men in their relations to the gods, when they
strove to propitiate them by supplications and sacrifices:
thus the prayer which we now translate by “Be gracious
unto us, O God,” meant originally, “Melt to us; be
softened, ye gods.”</p>

<p>Language grew and made offshoots, but without confusion;
disorder had no place in the progress of thought
(still less chance), which was simple and rational. This
was not the development of the conscious effort towards
some goal. At this period there was no such thing as
reflection properly so called; for instance, man did not<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
ponder how best to express a feeling of fear, since fear,
like so many other impressions, received vague expression
before the concept of fear acquired shape; but our ancestors
had a root to express shaking (in Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">kap</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">kamp</i>, to
shake): they used it to describe fear, which manifested
itself in the trembling of voice or limbs. Thus, “I shake”
might mean, “I shake a tree,” or “I am shaken,” “I am
shaken by him” (by my horse), but also “I am trembling”;
from it we have in Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">karnos</i>, smoke, not what shakes,
or is shaken, but what is in a shaking state, that which
moves; <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">kup</i>, which is probably a modification of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">kamp</i>,
means to shake inwardly, to be angry.</p>

<p>Some learned writers have felt disconcerted when after
tracing words to their source, they have found nothing but
roots with general meanings, such as to go, to move, to
run, to do; however, it is by means of these vague, pale
conceptions that language has obtained the material for an
entire language. The Aryan root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ar</i> signified originally
to go, to send, to advance, to proceed, going regularly, to
stir. Applied to the stirring of the soil, it took the
meaning of ploughing; in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ar-are</i>, in Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ar-oun</i>,
in Irish <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">ar</i>, in Lithuanian <i lang="lt" xml:lang="lt">ar-ti</i>, in Russian <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">ora-ti</i>; this
root, from its meaning of advancing regularly, was the
name of the plough; one derivative was applied to the
cattle fit for ploughing, and also to the labourer. <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ar</i> was
also used for the ploughing of the sea, or rowing, and was
found in the words rower and rudder. The Latin word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ævum</i>, originally from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i</i>, to go, became the name of time,
age; and its derivative <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æviternus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æturnus</i> was made to
express eternity. It was by a poetical fiat that the Greek
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probata</i>, which originally meant no more than things
walking forward, became in time the name of cattle. In
French, the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">meuble</i> means literally anything that is
movable, but it became the name of chairs, tables, wardrobes,
etc. In this way we see the power of language,
which, out of a few simple elements, has created<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
names sufficient to express the infinite aspects of
nature.</p>

<p>The ramifications of the Aryan root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Dâ</i> give a good idea
of the process. Thus <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Dâ</i> = to give, is in the Sanscrit
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dădāmi</i>, I give; in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">do</i>; in Old Slavonic, <i lang="cu" xml:lang="cu">da-mi</i>;
in Lithuanian, <i lang="lt" xml:lang="lt">du-mi</i>; in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donner</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pardonner</i>;
in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trado</i>, to give over; in Italian,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tradire</i>; in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trahir</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trahison</i>; in Latin again,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reddo</i>, to give back; in French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendre</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rente</i>. Side
by side with the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Dâ</i>, there is another root also <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Dâ</i>,
exactly the same in all outward appearance; it consists of
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">D</i> + <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Â</i>, but is totally distinct from the former. While
from the former we have in Sanscrit, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâ-tram</i>, a gift, we
have from the latter <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâ´-tram</i>, a sickle. The meaning of
the second root is to cut, to carve; the difference is shown
by the accent remaining on the radical syllable in <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâ´-tram</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, the cutting (active); whilst it leaves the radical
syllable in <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâ-trám</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, what is given (passive).</p>

<p>The history of these roots <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâ</i> affords an opportunity of
noticing a curious resemblance between natural history
and philology, two sciences which otherwise are totally
different, but alike in one idea which enters into the
inwardness of both. Darwin admitted four or five progenitors
in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, so that
the primary elements of all living organisms are the simple
cells. In the same way philologists have discovered that
there remain in the end certain simple elements of human
speech&mdash;the primordial roots&mdash;which have sufficed to provide
the innumerable multitude of words used by the
human race. A principle neglected by a great number of
evolutionists is that if two origins, whether the roots of
language or living cells, have at their starting-point an
absolutely similar appearance, and afterwards diverge, it is
because at their origin they bore in themselves the germs
destined to produce this divergence. Darwin says that
two organic cells, which in the embryonic stage may perfectly<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
resemble each other, in growing, gradually develop,
the one into an inferior animal, the other into a superior
animal, never varying the process; the reason of which
fact is that the cells, although not distinguishable the one
from the other, differ in the rudiments or principle of life:
in the same way philologists say that when two roots
have the same sound, but produce families of perfectly
distinct words, it is because the germs in each differ. We
learn from this that the sound of the words is a matter of
indifference at the commencement of a language; no one
has succeeded, or will succeed, in making the sound alone
the vehicle of a conception.</p>

<p>To Locke belongs the merit of having first clearly
asserted that roots, the true irreducible elements of
language, which furnish words for the most abstract and
sublime conceptions, had at the beginning only a material
or sensuous meaning, and this fact, on which idealists and
materialists are agreed, is confirmed by comparative philologists.
All primitive roots express directly only those acts
and those conditions which come under the domain of the
senses; all express the consciousness of repeated acts
familiar to the members of a society in its infancy, such
as pounding, striking, weaving, tying, burning, rubbing,
moving, cutting, sharpening, softening. By means of
generalisation and specialisation, the roots have acquired
the most abstract terms of our advanced society; thus the
root to burn developed into the thought of to love, and also
to be ashamed; to dig, came to mean to search for, to enquire;
the root which means to gather, expressed in primitive
logic what we now call observation of facts; the connection
of major and minor, or even syllogism. This is
without doubt, and it is as certain that the words rake
and pinchers came from the verbs to rake and to pinch.</p>

<p>To make the assertion of Locke the more striking,
Noiré adds: “When the representative words springing
from one root are found side by side, it is always the<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
more ancient of the two which expresses the more material
act. The verbs to tear and to cut are the offshoots of a
single root; but the passage from the concept of tearing to
that of cutting would be slowly effected; the act of tearing
was immediate with man, cutting was a mediate act, and
of later date, since it could not be done whilst the instrument
was lacking.”</p>

<p>I shall now bridge over the distance between the
primordial roots, and the organised language as we possess
it, in order to show how our ancestors succeeded in forming
real phrases, that is to say, intelligible propositions; this
will show us the continuous thread which connects our
present language with primitive speech.</p>

<p>We can show that both dictionary and grammar are
made up of predicative roots and demonstrative elements.
By the help of the first we make affirmations concerning
things, derived from our knowledge of another object or of
many, either in combination under one name, or taking
each separately. With the demonstrative element we point
to any object in space or time, by using such words as
this, that, then, here, there; near, far, above, below, and
others of the same kind, whose existence may be explained
as a survival of the gesticulating phase in which objects
were neither conceived nor described but pointed out;
from this we are not to infer that gestures&mdash;even accompanied
by sounds&mdash;gave birth to speech, since they rather
excluded it. In their primitive form and intention, these
demonstrative elements are addressed to the senses rather
than to the intellect. They have in themselves no meaning,
and to be of service they must be attached to words
that have. The history of the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan</i>, to dig, will
explain my thought. When our Aryan ancestors had learnt
to say <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan</i>, and they wanted to distinguish between those
who were digging and the instruments used in digging,
between the object of the digging and the time and place
of the work, it is possible that these demonstrative suffixes,<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
combined with predicative roots, formed bases, such
as <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan-ana</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan-i</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan-a</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan-itra</i>, and still
others, which were intended probably for digging-here,
digging-now, dig-we, dig-you. By means of these combinations,
which varied in their application according to
the customs of different villages and families, the speaker
sought to distinguish between the subject acting and the
object acted upon; and when this difficulty was surmounted,
a great step had been taken, the passage from
perception to conception was accomplished, and this
passage no philosopher prior to Noiré had made clear.
“We must always bear in mind that we are speaking here
of times, so far beyond the reach of history, and of intellectual
processes so widely removed from our own, that
none would venture to speak dogmatically on what was
actually passing in the minds of the early framers of
language when they first uttered these words.”<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> All we
can do is to hazard an explanation, and accept it in as far
as it seems reasonable; and in the interest of science, we
must carefully guard ourselves from asserting that our
theory is the only true one. It is easy to conceive that
after centuries of constant use certain derivatives should
have become unalterably attached to certain meanings,
and others should have also retained their special meanings.
But what we do not know, is how the sounds destined to
become demonstrative elements or personal pronouns were
restricted to the terms required for such words, as&mdash;here,
there, those, he, I, that, etc. There were cases in which a
verb in the infinitive would develop into a phrase without
any additions being made to it; it would suffice, for
instance, if a man uttered the word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Khan</i> in a commanding
voice&mdash;as we should say “work”&mdash;for his fellow-labourers
to understand that they were to begin to dig.
Thus the imperative could be considered a complete
sentence with as much justice as Veni-Vedi-Vici would<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
be termed independent and complete sentences. “The
shortest sentence of all is, no doubt, the imperative, and it
is in the imperative that almost to the present day roots
retain their simplest form.”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Our intellects in the present day are developed by the
discourses we hear, the books we read, the reflections
suggested by our experiences of life; our vocabularies
become enriched as our knowledge increases and embraces
a greater number of subjects; and if we retrace the path
taking us to our ancestors who could not count beyond
four sometimes, we should find words and ideas becoming
fewer and conspicuous by their absence. It does not
therefore follow that because we use language that we
made it. It is not our invention; to us every language
is traditional. “The words in which we think are
channels of thought which we have not dug ourselves,
but which we found ready made for us. The work of
making language belongs to a period in the history of
mankind beyond the reach of the ordinary historian, and
of which we in our advanced state of mental development
can hardly form a clear conception.” Yet that time must
have been a fact not less possible of verification than that
geological period when “the earth was absorbed in producing
the carboniferous vegetation which still supplies us
with the means of warmth, light, and life, accumulating
during enormous periods of time small deposits of organic
matter forming the strata of the globe on which we
live. In the same manner the human mind formed that
linguistic vegetation, the produce of which still supplies
the stores of our grammars and dictionaries”; and after a
close examination of these primordial roots whence our
language has sprung, we find that it does not consist in
a conglomeration of words, the result of an agreement
amongst a certain number of men, or the result of chance,
but expresses human activity by means of verbs, the living<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
and vivifying portion of speech by the side of which the
remainder may almost be considered as dead matter.</p>

<p>The question of the birth of the substantive, without
being deliberately posed as a problem, occupied the minds
of the Grecian philosophers, and was involved in their researches
concerning the relation of an object to the name
it bears, of the unknown cause by which a certain name
designates a certain object and no other. Whilst the
Greeks speculated on the subject after a tentative manner,
building up theories which later observations were not
long in upsetting, the Hindoos were also engaged in
efforts to solve the problem by the help of a more reliable
process&mdash;the historical.</p>

<p>The early grammarians, having found that words came
from roots expressing general concepts, and that these
concepts represented some sort of activity, made this fact
the basis of their studies; profound thinkers as they were
they discovered that man at first could not give a name
to a tree, an animal, a star, a river, nor to any other
object without discovering first some special quality that
seemed at the time most characteristic of the object to be
named. Sanscrit has a root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">As</i>, having amongst other
meanings sharpness, quickness; from the same root came
words for needle, point, sharpness of sight, quickness of
thought; this root is found in the Sanscrit name for a
horse, which is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">asva</i>, runner or racer, one who leaves space
quickly behind him. Many other names might have been
given to the horse besides the one here mentioned, but all
must recall some characteristic trait of this animal; that
name, <em>the quick</em>, could also have been given to other
animals, but having been repeatedly applied to one, it
became unfit for other purposes, and the horse retains
undisputed possession. The Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">aksha</i>, eye, comes
from the same root as, which also meant to point, to
pierce. Another name for eye in Sanscrit is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">netram</i>,
leader, from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nî</i>, to lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>Noiré has just put forth an ingenious theory, that the
first substantives would not be miller, digger, weaver,
carpenter; but flour, cave, pit, mat, hedge, club, arrow,
boat, because these were what had been thought and
willed, whilst the agents, of no account from that point
of view, remained in the shade, forgotten, and it is
possible that for some time no names were given to
them.</p>

<p>“When we have once seen that thought in its true
sense is always conceptual, taking a verbal form, and
that every word is derived from a conceptual root, we
shall be ready for the assertion that words being conceptual
can never stand for a single percept.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Max
Müller.</span></p>

<p>Locke first insisted that names are not the signs of
things themselves, but always the signs of our concepts of
them. This remark received small attention at first, and
remained little appreciated until such time as the discoveries
of our contemporaries, with no preconcerted
unanimity, confirmed its value. Max Müller explains
Locke’s words in the following manner: “Each time that
we use a general name, if we say dog, tree, chair, we have
not these objects before our eyes, only our concepts of
them; there can be nothing in the world of sense corresponding
even to such simple words as dog, tree, chair.
We can never expect to see a dog, a tree, a chair. Dog
means every kind of dog from the greyhound to the
spaniel; tree, every kind of tree from the oak to the
cherry; chair, every kind of chair from the royal throne
to the artisan’s stool. We may see a spaniel or a Newfoundland dog;
we may see a fir or an apple tree; we
may see such and such a chair. People often imagine
that they can form a general image of a dog by leaving
out what is peculiar to every individual dog.”<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>This general idea we have in our mind of which we<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
can talk, but our eyes cannot see it as they could a
real object. Nothing that we name, nothing that we
find in our dictionary can ever be heard, or seen, or felt.
“We can even have names for things which never existed,
such as gnomes; also for things which exist no more, or
which exist not yet, such as the grapes of the last harvest,
and those of the next. The mere fact that I call a thing
past or future ought to be sufficient to show that it is my
concept of which I am speaking, and not the thing as
independent of me.”<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Berkeley showed that it is simply impossible for any
human being to make to himself a general image of a
triangle, for such an image would have to be at the same
time right-angled, obtuse-angled, acute-angled, and other
kinds also; such an object does not exist; whereas it is
perfectly possible to have an image of any single triangle;
to name some characteristic features common to all triangles,
and thus to form a name and at the same time a
concept of a triangle.<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> This mental process which Berkeley
described so well as applied to modern concepts we can
adopt with regard to all, even the most primitive. Man,
in entering a forest, discovered in the trees something
that was interesting to him. For practical purposes trees
were particularly interesting to the primitive framers of
language, because they could be split in two, three, or
four pieces, cut, shaped according to the size of the piece
into blocks, planks, boats, and shafts; any object for
which the necessity had made itself felt. Hence, from a
root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dar</i>, to tear, our Aryan ancestors called trees <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dru</i>, or
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dâru</i>, literally what can be torn, or split, or cut; from
the same root the Greeks called the skin of an animal
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dérma</i>, because it was torn off, and a sack <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dóros</i> (in
Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">driti</i>), because it was made of leather, and a
spear <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dóry</i>, because it came from a tree, and was cut and
shaped and planed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>Such words being once given would produce many offshoots;
the Celts of Gaul and of Ireland called their
priests <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Druids</i>, literally the men of oak-groves. The
Greeks called the spirits of the forest trees <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Dryades</i>; and the
Hindoos called a man of wood, or a man with a wooden,
or, as we say, flinty heart, <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">dâruna</i>, cruel.</p>

<p>The immense number of intelligible roots gave birth to
many new images, these roots crossed and recrossed, for
the concepts of to go, to give, to move, to make, would be
the foundations of others, in some ways differing; one
idea or thought in its flight would meet others perhaps
of a conflicting nature, thoughts and words would equally
undergo incessant modifications, which fact explains why
in these earlier stages of language the members of a community
soon ceased to understand each other if separated
but for a short period of time.</p>

<p>Ovid, in speaking of the chaos at the beginning of the
world, makes a picture which would equally well describe
the birth of language. “Matter was in an unformed
mass ... the sky, the earth, the sea had all one aspect;
there where was the earth, was also the sea, and the sky
was there also.”</p>

<p>The extraordinary destinies of the roots I have named
constitutes a short chapter only, in the birth and development
of tongues; but short as it is, it suffices to give us
an idea of the elastic nature of these roots, their faculty
of extension, and the part they play in the economy of
language, and in the administration of the affairs of the
human mind.</p>

<p>Every mental phenomenon has its history, which can
only be discovered by tracing it to its source; and as
speech has undergone many phases, of which the earlier
must have been very different from those now in existence,
it is pardonable in the greatest philosophers of antiquity
not to have known the intricacies of the human mind,
which this changeable speech could alone interpret. The<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
ancients knew their own times, but were ignorant of the
preceding ones, in the same way they knew their own
language only, and of this language only its contemporary
form; and in the case of a word whose meaning was lost
or of a foreign word, they sought its origin in an idiom
with which they were familiar; in other words, not where
it could be found.</p>

<p>For a long time man only knew one kind of being, his
own; and possessed one language only, that which expressed
his own acts and his own states; the primitive
men were sufficiently advanced to say: “let us dig,” “grind,”
“they weave”; but if, at the beginning, concepts and speech
arose from the consciousness of their own activity, how
was the advance made when men desired to speak of the
external objects of the world which they saw around them,
and were conscious of not having made, and which consequently
remained outside the sphere of their wills and
of their experience? It is clear that these outward objects
to be grasped and named, must have their part in the
human activities for which names had already been found.
When he saw the lightning tearing a hole in the field, or
splitting the trunk of a tree, man could no longer say,
“<em>We</em> have dug this hole, <em>you</em> have split the tree.” It
was no longer <em>someone</em>, but <em>something</em> that had dug and
struck. Nothing seems more simple to us than after
saying “<em>I dig</em>” to say also “<em>it digs</em>,” and yet it was a
passing to a new world of thought, from the conscious
feeling of our own activity to the intuition of the activity
of an outward object; this mental act, though inevitable,
was by no means an easy one; men realised that the
world around was a reflex of themselves, the only light
was the light from within. If men could measure, so
could the moon; hence he was called the measurer of the
sky, from the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mâ</i>, to measure; the moon was called
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mâs</i>, that which measures, its actual name in Sanscrit;
in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis</i>; in Greek, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mêné</i>; English, <em>moon</em>;<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
German, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Monat</i>; in Russian, <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">miésets</i>. Men who ran
called themselves runners; also the rivers they named <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sar</i>,
running; and to designate the position of the river they
added the suffix <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">it</i>, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sar-it</i>; literally, running here. Thus
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sarit</i> is river in Sanscrit; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mâs</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sarit</i> thus become
complete, intelligible sentences. What we call lightning
was originally, tearing, digging, bursting, sparkling; what
we call storm and tempest were, grinding, smashing,
bursting, blowing; if man could smash, so could the
thunderbolt, hence it was called the smasher; and tempest
and storm and thunderbolt may have been, smashing,
grinding, hurling; and with the addition of the suffix,
smashing here, now, there, then.</p>

<p>We have seen that the attribute which was the peculiar
characteristic of an object supplied its name, but as most
objects possessed more than one attribute, more than one
designation were given to it; thus several names were
used for river besides <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sarit</i>, each representing one of its
aspects; when flowing in a straight line it was called
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sîrâ</i>, arrow, plough, plougher; if it seemed to nourish the
fields it was <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mâtar</i>, mother; if it separated or protected
one country from another, it became <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sindhu</i>, the defender,
from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sidh</i> or <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sedhati</i>, to keep off; if it became a torrent
it received the name of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nadi</i>, noisy. In all these forms
the river is considered as acting, and is named by roots
expressing action; it nourishes, it traces a furrow, it
guards, it roars as a wild beast roars. The sun has many
attributes; he is brilliant, the warmer, the generator, the
scorcher, he is vivifying, overpowering, his many qualities
giving him fifty different names, all synonyms of the sun.
The earth also had many, it was known by twenty-one
names, amongst others it was <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">urvî</i>, wide; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">jurithvî</i>, broad;
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mahî</i>, great; but each characteristic trait of the earth
could also be found in other objects, thus <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">urivî</i> also meant
a river; sky and dawn were called <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">prithvî</i>; and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mahî</i>
(great, strong) is used for cow and speech. Hence earth,<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
river, sky, dawn, cow, and speech would become
homonyms.</p>

<p>These names are of clearly defined objects, all recognisable
by the senses; this fact entitles us to apply the
following definition to this primitive stage of language; the
conscious expression of impressions perceived by the senses.</p>

<p>But there is another class of words differing somewhat
from those we have named, such words, as day, night,
spring, winter, dawn and twilight; these lack the individuality
and tangibleness of the others; and when we
say “day approaches, night comes,” we attribute acts to
things which are not agents, we affirm propositions, which,
logically analysed, have no properly defined subjects. Semi-tangible
names, such as sky, earth, belong to the same
category. When we say “the earth nourishes man,” we
do not allude to any well defined portion of the soil, we
take the earth as a whole; and the sky is not only the
small portion of the horizon grasped by our eyes, our
imagination conceives objects not within the ken of our
senses, but inasmuch as we look upon the earth or sky as
a whole, see in it a power or an ideal, we make of it,
involuntarily, an individuality. Now these words had
certain terminations affixed to them indicating what we
call gender, and became masculine or feminine, the neuter
gender at that time did not enter into the language, until
thought becoming more lucid perceived it in nature. What
was the result? That it was impossible to speak of morning
or night, of spring or winter, of dawn or twilight, of sky
and earth, without clothing them not only with active and
individual characteristics, but with personal and sexual
attributes; hence all the objects of discourse as used by the
founders of language became necessarily so many actors,
as men and women act; and thought, when once launched
in this direction, being irresistibly attracted by the
tendency towards analogy and metaphor, overspread the
whole world of human experience with this method of<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
representation. What is called animism, anthropomorphism,
and personification, have therefore their source in this inevitable
dynamic stage, as Max Müller calls it, of thought
and language, in which the psychological necessity of representing
the external objects as resembling themselves
operated on our ancestors. This necessity might have
been named subjectivism had it not received more specific
terms such as <em>animism</em>, which consists in conceiving of
inanimate objects as animate; <em>anthropomorphism</em>, conceiving
objects as men, and <em>personification</em>, conceiving
objects as persons. As soon as this new mental act was
performed, a new world was called into existence, a world
of names, or as we now call it, the world of myths.</p>

<p>“So long as the real identity of thought and language
had not been grasped, so long as people imagined that
language is one thing and thought another, it was but
natural that they should fail to see the real meaning of
treating mythology, if not as a disease, at all events as
an inevitable affection of language. If the active verb
was merely a grammatical, and not at the same time a
psychological, nay, an historical fact, it might seem
absurd to identify the active meaning of our roots with
the active meaning ascribed to the phenomena of nature.
But let it be once perceived that language and thought
are one and indivisible, and nothing will seem more natural
than that what, as the grammarian tells us, happened in
language, should, as the psychologist tells us, have likewise
happened in thought.”<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The men who spoke in this manner of the external
phenomena understood perfectly that they themselves, who
struck, who measured, who ran, who rose up, who lay
down, were not to be confounded with the thunder, the
moon, the river, and the sun; those scholars who studied
thought as apart from language, rather allowed themselves
selves to be misled by the phraseology of the time, and<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
considered it a proof that our Aryan ancestors looked upon
their physical surroundings as human beings, endowed
with the appropriate organs and acts. Not only had the
early Aryans perfectly understood that they were not
identical with themselves, but they were far more struck
by the differences between them than by any imaginary
similarities. The confirmation of this theory is preserved
for us in the Veda. “The torrent is roaring&mdash;not a bull,”
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> like a bull; instead of saying as we do, “firm as a
rock,” the poets of the Veda would say “firm&mdash;not a
rock.” “The mountains were <em>not</em> to be thrown down,
but they were <em>not</em> warriors,” “The fire was eating up the
forest, yet it was <em>not</em> a lion.”</p>

<p>The men of that time used few words; all thoughts
that went beyond the narrow horizon of their daily and
practical lives had to be expressed by the transference of a
name from the object to which it properly belongs to other
well known objects. It was the birth of metaphor; it was
metaphor that enabled the inner consciousness to project
itself into the outer chaos of the world of objects; which
it recreated with personal images; and the fact that each
natural phenomenon bore many names, and that these
same names were used for many other different objects
furnished germs of metaphor. Metaphor was to language
what rain and sunshine are to the harvest, it multiplies
each grain a hundred and a thousand fold; and metaphor
in multiplying language disperses it in every direction;
without it no language would have progressed beyond the
simplest rudiments.</p>

<p>We must be careful not to confuse the radical metaphor
with the poetical which we use daily, and which is very
different from the former. If we open any book of poetry
at whatever page, we shall find inanimate and mute objects
described as speaking, rejoicing, praising their Creator;
there is no portion of nature however insentient, however
incapable of thought, in which we do not infuse our own<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
sentiments, our own ideas. This mode of expression is
especially a poet’s prerogative, and that it does not strike
us as incongruous is owing to the fact that poetry appeals
to the generality of men, and is more natural to them than
prose, and that this outpouring of our heart towards nature
costs us less effort than to speak of it in the abstract. It
requires cold reflection to describe lightning as an electrical
discharge, and rain as condensed vapour; in this case
it is no longer the transference of the characteristic of a
known object to one still unknown, but that of a known
object to another equally well known; the poet who transfers
the word tear to the dew has already clear names and
concepts both for tear and dew; the poetical metaphor is
thus a voluntary creative act of our mind, and as such
takes no part in the formation of the human mind.</p>

<p>The world was astonished some few years ago by a
declaration made by students of the science of language
that the 250,000 words comprehended in the English
Dictionary now being published at Oxford all proceeded
from about 800 roots; and it has now been found possible
to reduce this number. In any case 500 to 800 Sanscrit
roots, on account of their great fertility, sufficed our Aryan
ancestors for all the many words occurring in Sanscrit
literature, and suffice also for us who have 245,000 living
animals and 95,000 fossil specimens to name; also
100,000 living and 2500 fossil plants, without speaking
of crystals, metals and minerals. Another surprising
discovery is that every thought that has ever passed through
a human brain can be expressed in 121 radical concepts, of
which I give a list. It is taken from Max Müller’s <cite>Science
of Thought</cite>, p. 404. Each single word of every phrase
that we use has its origin in one of the 800 roots, and not
a thought but proceeds from the 121 fundamental concepts.
This is as accepted a fact as that all that is visible
on the earth and in the vault of heaven is composed of
about 60 elementary substances.</p>

<p>This classification of the roots is purely tentative. It<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
has been difficult to ascertain what is most likely to have
been the original meaning of some; there are certain
words of which it is almost impossible to find the
etymology. The order in which the concepts succeed
each other is not very systematic. Max Müller tried to
classify them more correctly by keeping the special acts,
such as to dig, the general acts, such as to find, the special
states, such as to cough, and the general states, such as to
stand&mdash;together. But it was impossible to adhere strictly
to such a plan, because there are roots which express both
acts and states; while in many cases it is difficult to determine
whether the special or general meaning predominates;
thus there are the words to boil, to make boil, or to be
boiling. Some of the roots have closely allied meanings,
so that there are as many as fifteen connected with the
concepts to burn, and to speak; and many more which
can be traced to shine.</p>

<p>We experience feelings at once humbling and elevating
when we consider that all we admire, all on which we
pride ourselves, our thoughts, whether poetical, philosophical,
religious, our whole literature, all our dictionaries,
whether scientific or industrial; in fact, our whole intellectual
life is built upon this small number of mother-ideas,
of 121 concepts. We should feel neither humbled
nor elevated; we are making use of the wisdom of our
ancestors. It is our duty to transmit the legacy to our
descendants which they gave us, but purged from alloy.</p>

<p>Three chief points are to be noted, when we are
concerned with the progress of the intellect:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The creative activity of humanity is the basis of all
the roots of words.</p>

<p>2. The source of all abstract ideas lies in acts which are
entirely material.</p>

<p>3. It has been satisfactorily proved that we speak the
language derived from that spoken by our primitive
ancestors. It was the custom of Nebuchadnezzar to have<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
his name stamped on every brick that was used during his
reign in erecting his colossal palaces. Those palaces fell
to ruins, but from the ruins the ancient materials were
carried away for building new cities; and on examining
the bricks in the walls of the modern city of Bagdad,
travellers have discovered on every one the clear traces of
that royal signature. Our modern languages were built
up with the materials taken from the ruins of the ancient
languages, and every word that we pronounce displays the
royal stamp impressed upon it by the founders. The
formation of those derived languages, by means of the
roots with their successive change of meaning, the construction
of their grammatical forms, the continued
changes amongst the different dialects, all indicate the
presence of a germ in man tending from the first to make
him a reasoning being.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ANCIENT LANGUAGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Language may be divided into three distinct periods, when
taken as a whole.</p>

<p>The first is, when language, finding itself released from
those restraints which enveloped it in its cradle, supplies
those words which are most indispensable to man in
connecting the one word with others, such as pronouns,
prepositions, names of numbers, and of objects of daily
use. This must have been the first stage of a language
hardly yet agglutinate, free from trammels, with no sign
of nationality, or individuality, but containing in itself all
the chief features of the many forms belonging to the
Turanian, Aryan and Semitic families; the explorer of philosophic
antiquity does not penetrate beyond this first period.</p>

<p>The second phase is that in which two linguistic families
passing out of the agglutinate stage, unattached as yet to
grammatical forms, received once for all the stamp of the
formation which we find amongst the popular and modern
dialects belonging both to the Semitic and Aryan divisions,
and to which they owe this family resemblance, which
justifies their inclusion in one or other of these branches
of language; on the one side the Teutonic, Celtic, Slav,
Italic, Hellenic, Iranian and Indian; on the other Arabic,
Armenian and Hebrew; the yet unformed elements of
grammar were eventually introduced into these languages
at the substitution of the amalgamate for the agglutinate.
The Turanian or Ural-Altaic languages have an entirely
different character; they preserved for some time&mdash;and
one or two still retain&mdash;the agglutinate form which retards<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
the development of the grammar, and hides the evidence
of relationship to the languages between China and the
Pyrenees, and between Cape Comorin and Lapland.</p>

<p>These two periods are followed by a third, generally
known as the mythological; it is obscure, and is calculated
to shake one’s faith in the regular and orderly progress of
human reason. We find it to be a phase through which
all peoples have passed; yet in using the word mythology
our thoughts naturally turn to the mythology of Greece,
the only one with which we were made acquainted in our
school days, and also the only one with which those were
familiar who had not given themselves over specially to
the study of the beliefs of antiquity. In the schools this
study ran side by side with history; from our earliest
days we had been taught the complete polytheism of
heathen divinities; our work as pupils was to know our
lessons, the work of the masters was to see that we learnt
them. Mythology, therefore, was to us only one chapter
in that great work, entitled the compulsory course of
studies&mdash;a chapter which apparently required no more
elucidation than the gymnastic lesson.</p>

<p>Our masters represented the Greeks as a people endowed
with a vivid imagination, who recounted in exalted pure
language most fantastic stories; we read in these
authors: “Eos has fled&mdash;Eos will return&mdash;Eos has
returned&mdash;Eos wakens the sleepers&mdash;Eos lengthens the
life of mortals&mdash;Eos rises from the sea&mdash;Eos is the
daughter of the sky&mdash;Eos is followed by the sun&mdash;Eos is
loved by the sun&mdash;Eos is killed by the sun,” and so on
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>; and we were told, “These are myths.” As
no explanation was given of the word myth, we were none
the wiser.</p>

<p>If the movements of Eos are inexplicable, they are not
without a certain picturesqueness. But what shall we say
of the myth concerning Saturn, who, on account of a prediction
that he would be killed by his children, swallowed<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
them as soon as they were born, with the exception of
Jupiter, who was saved by the substitution of a stone,
which Saturn afterwards brought up with the children he
had swallowed. Or again, what can be said of the feast
offered to the gods by Tantalus to test their omniscience;
he caused the members of the body of his son Pelops to be
mixed with other meats; a shoulder was eaten before
Jupiter discovered the deception; he ordered the remainder
to be thrown into a copper from which Pelops
emerged alive with one shoulder lacking, and one made
of ivory was given to him. Can anything more grotesque
be imagined? And our children are subjected to this
regimen, and their memories charged with these fables,
under the pretext that they will the better appreciate the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs-d’œuvre</i> of classical literature.</p>

<p>The enigmatical part of this period of language will be
more evident if we examine the early traditional history
which began at its close, and at which time a light
appeared in Greece destined to flood the world with a
splendour hitherto unknown; it was the epoch which
produced Thales, Pythagoras and Heraclitus, who, in the
midst of much ignorance, had thoughts of wonderful
lucidity. A national literature was beginning, where we
find indications of the germs of political societies; the
creation of laws, and the development of morals. And
we ask ourselves: Whence come these sages? Who
were their masters? How could these glorious days of
Greek civilisation have been preceded by several generations
whose principal occupation seemed to consist in
inventing and repeating to satiety absurd fables concerning
gods, heroes, and other beings whom no human being
had ever seen; which fables contravene the simplest
principles of logic, morality and religion? The ancient
sages themselves were harsh in their judgment of these
revolting stories contained in Grecian mythology; Xenophanes,
a contemporary of Pythagoras, considered Hesiod<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
and Homer responsible for these superstitions, and
blamed them for attributing to the gods all that was most
reprehensible in man. Heraclitus was of opinion that
Homer deserved to be banished from the public assemblies,
and Plato wrote, “Mothers and nurses tell their children
stories full of misstatements and immoralities which are
gathered from the poets.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke philosophers 500 years before our era,
because they knew that if the “gods commit anything
that is evil they are no gods.”</p>

<p>“Taken by themselves and in their literal meaning,
most of these ancient myths are absurd and irrational, and
frequently opposed to the principles of thought, religion,
and morality which guided the Greeks as soon as they
appear to us in the twilight of traditional history.”<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Many explanations have been sought to account in
a rational manner for these strange tales; writers have
striven to discover what can have given rise to such
ridiculous inventions; some have asserted that it was
the intention of the authors of mythology to convey to
the people a knowledge of certain facts of nature, and
certain moral truths whilst clothing them in allegorical
form, and by endowing the divinities with certain virtues
which it would become men to imitate and acquire; and
that the worship of these divinities was instituted that
man might be more fully impressed, that the likeness of
the virtues upheld might be more deeply engraved in the
heart of the pious worshipper. Zeus, was mind; Athene,
art; Hercules, energy and perseverance in labours of great
difficulty; whilst the Homeric heroes, Agamemnon, Achilles,
and Hector represented physical activities. According to
another theory the object with which the myths were
composed was political, the laws of government were
supposed to emanate from the gods; and whoso refused
to recognise the excellence of the institutions of the<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
country was held to be in revolt against the gods themselves.
The philosopher Euhemerus was the author of
a third theory, called the historical; he represented the
mythological personages not as gods, but as kings, heroes,
and philosophers, who, after their death, had received
divine honours among their fellow men; in this system
Eolus, the god of the winds, became a skilful mariner
who could foretell atmospheric changes; Atlas, supporting
the sky and earth on his wide shoulders, had been formerly
a great astronomer; Jupiter, a ruler of Crete; Hercules,
a knight-errant. Although these ancient writers interpreted
the fables in so many different ways, they all agreed
in denying that an atom of truth is found in these stories
concerning the gods, and they insisted that no myth must
be taken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au pied de la lettre</i>. At a later period it was
thought that reminiscences of a barbaric age could be found
in which the ancestors of the Greeks apparently occupied
themselves by stealing, killing, deceiving, and eating their
offspring. “Lactantius, St Augustine, and the first missionaries,
in their attacks on the religious belief of the
Greeks, and Romans availed themselves of these arguments
of Euhemerus, and taunted them with worshipping gods
that were no gods, but known and admitted to have been
merely deified mortals.”<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In later times the same theory
was revived; certain theologians, rather lacking in penetration,
looked to Greek mythology for traces of sacred
personages, they imagined that they could recognise in
Saturn and his three sons, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto,
the features of Noah and his sons, Ham, Japhet, and
Shem; and in a recently published book the author
suggests that when Hesiod describes the garden of the
Hesperides, we have a tradition of the garden of Eden.</p>

<p>Thus from the moment when, for the first time, the
ancient philosophers questioned “why?” from the time
of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, to our own practical<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
and matter-of-fact century, mythology has not ceased to
compel attention, and to furnish endless matter of conjecture.
Learned writers have sought in physical sciences,
history, and metaphysics, an explanation of this phenomenon;
but in spite of this vast labour inspired by a
love of science, and carried on for more than two thousand
years, the secret of the sphinx of mythology remains undisclosed,
and we still ask, “what is mythology?” Is it
an invention of Homer and Hesiod? Or is it a phase in
the development of the human mind, a deviation in the
growth of reason?</p>

<p>The school of philology has a solution of its own to
offer; will it be as futile as the others? After hearing
it shall we still say the Sphinx is mute? This school
takes upon itself to assert that the explanation of the
mystery can only be found in the Science of Language.
It is a fact that the history of language&mdash;which is the
history of the human mind&mdash;enables us to answer the
preceding questions categorically. Yes. Mythology was
inevitable, an inherent part of language itself, to be considered,
not as a simple external symbol, but as the only
incorporation of thought possible. Mythology, in the
widest acceptation of the term, is the shadow which
language casts on thought; and the whole history of
philosophy from Thales to Hegel has been one uninterrupted
struggle with mythology, a constant protest between
thought and language.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">MYTHS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In order to appreciate truly our neighbour’s impressions
and points of view, we must constantly detach ourselves
from our own special way of seeing and feeling; this habit
of abstraction&mdash;which is most difficult to every one&mdash;is
indispensable when we are endeavouring to understand the
natures of persons who lived many thousands of years ago,
and who thought and spoke in a totally different manner
from ourselves.</p>

<p>In seeking to grasp the phraseology of myths we
perceive that its chief elements consist in a repetition
of phrases in which the acts of nature are used as embodiments
of the idea, under the figures of day and
night, dawn and twilight, the sun and the moon, the
heavens and the earth, as they stand in relation to man.</p>

<p>When we in the present century speak of the last hours
of the day, we use precise and exact terms; we say, “It
is late; the sun is setting; the moon rises; it is night.”
Our ancestors also had occasion to mention these same
hours, but as they did not speak of the facts of nature
without investing them with some of their own personality,
they preferred to say, “Dawn flies before the sun.” “The
sun loves&mdash;pursues&mdash;embraces the dawn.” “She dies in
the arms of the sun.” They spoke of the sun growing
old&mdash;decaying&mdash;dying. Besides these general terms our
ancestors used special designations, which the nature of
their language suggested; the hymns of the Rig-Veda
supply instances. One of these modes of speech it would
be difficult for me to render in French, but the English<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
language has the impersonal verb which will illustrate my
meaning, for all such atmospheric phenomena such as
rain, thunder, the light of day; instead of <em>it</em> rains, <em>it</em>
thunders, <em>it</em> shines, our ancestors said, <em>he</em> rains, <em>he</em> thunders,
<em>he</em> shines, without knowing who was this <em>he</em>, who for us
is the third person masculine; but, naturally for them, <em>he</em>
meant the rainer, the thunderer, the lightener, or, in other
words&mdash;the agent.</p>

<p>Mythology, taken in its entirety, is the outcome of
myths which preceded it. If the original meaning of the
Greek word Logos&mdash;as both word and thought&mdash;has
revealed to us a forgotten truth; the original meaning of
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">mythos</i> is also indispensable for the study of mythology.
This Greek term means simply <em>word</em> as opposed to <em>deed</em>,
and hardly differed at first from Logos. Afterwards, however,
a distinction was made between myth,&mdash;a fable, a
story, and logos, a historical account. Thus a myth was
at first a word. Almost all terms used in the first spontaneous
stage of language had for their basis striking
metaphors, whose signification may have been forgotten,
and these terms having lost their original as well as
poetical meaning, remained words only, current in familiar
conversation.</p>

<p>I give the following myths as they have come down
to us.</p>

<p>Endymion is the son of Zeus and Kalyke, but he is also
the son of Æthlios, a king of Elis, who is himself called a
son of Zeus; for, according to Greek customs, the reigning
race of Elis derived its origin from the king of the gods.
Endymion is one of the many names of the sun, but with
special reference to the setting or dying sun; it is derived
from a verb which originally meant <em>to dive into</em>; an
expression such as “the sun dived” presupposes an earlier
conception, that it dived into the sea. But the verb <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">enduo</i>
is never used in classical Greek for setting, because the
simple verb <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">duo</i> had become the technical term for sunset.<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
Thus this myth of Endymion owes its origin to the use
probably of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">enduo</i> in some Greek dialect, though not the
commonly received term for sunset. The original meaning
of Endymion being once forgotten, what was told
originally of the setting sun was now told of a name,
which in order to have any meaning, had to be changed
into a god or hero.</p>

<p>This handsome prince or shepherd, according to the
different versions of the tale, went to Karia, where on
Mount Latmos he had strange adventures; he slept in a
cave to which the rays of the moon, Selene, penetrated, and
in the ancient poetical and proverbial language of Elis
it was said, “Selene loves and watches Endymion; Selene
embraces Endymion and kisses him into sleep.” The
name Selene is so transparent that the word moon pierces
through it; we should have guessed that the moon was
intended, even if tradition had only preserved her other
name, Asterodia&mdash;“wanderer amongst the stars”; the
names Hecate or Lucina do not force us to acknowledge
their fitness, they present to our imagination a totally
different figure (as they suggest opaqueness) from Selene.
Learned writers at times still put forward the explanation
with regard to mythology that it “was a past which was
never a present,” but this myth of Endymion was “present”
with the people of Elis at the period of its
narration.</p>

<p>These and similar expressions were repeated long after
their meaning had ceased to be understood; and as the
human mind is generally as anxious for a reason as ready
to invent one, the poets added to this story several details,
and reasons why Endymion sank into eternal sleep after a
life of but one day; and if allusions were made to these
by a popular poet, it became a mythological fact, repeated
and embellished by later poets.</p>

<p>The construction of such a name as Eos does not differ
materially from that of any other name, but as all roots<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
expressed at the first denote action, it follows that for all an
agent must be found; the name of Eos in Sanscrit is
Ushas, dawn, or “the bright one” from the root Vas, to
shine; thus Eos meant originally “he or she shines.” But
who was “he” or “she”? Thus the inevitable myth is
evolved. For us the dawn is only the natural illumination
of the sky, the brightness of the morning; our
ancestors received a different impression by the break of
day. After having coined a word meaning “he or she
shines,” that is the light, or Eos, the Greeks continued to
portray each step of Eos as she preceded the appearance of
the sun on the celestial vault; “Eos is followed by the
sun&mdash;is loved by the sun”; she is conceived as a bright
and beautiful woman; if she appeared veiled in clouds,
she would be considered as a veiled bride; thus the
epithets and relationships showered on Eos become
intelligible, she is the daughter of Hyperion, thus her
father would be the high heaven, since <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">hyper</i> corresponds
to the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super</i>; she is the sister of Helios and Selene,
the sun and the moon. As soon as a name such as Eos
was first enunciated and used in daily conversation, it
grew and gathered new materials round itself; all the
names surrounding Eos in Greek and Aurora in Latin
show us how inevitably what we call mythology springs
up from the soil of language. Even such simple sentences
as “Eos appears, disappears, or dies” are changed at
once into myth, fable, and legend, and it soon becomes
impossible to draw a line between what is simple
language and what is myth.</p>

<p>We do not unfortunately always possess the original
form of each legend as it first passed from mouth to mouth
in the towns and country; thus our chief sources are the
ancient chroniclers, who took mythology for history, and
used only so much of it as answered their purpose, and
these accounts do not reach us at first hand.</p>

<p>We find a legend in Greek mythology which has much<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
exercised the learned; the nymph Daphne flies before
Phœbus Apollo, her mother, the earth, moved by compassion,
takes her to her bosom, and immediately a laurel
appears and fills the abyss into which Daphne had
vanished. The mythologists asked themselves what could
be the meaning of this; the more phlegmatic amongst
them considered that it had no special meaning at all,
but was simply to be looked upon as a fable; why seek
further for a hidden import? Why? Because people do
not relate such stories concerning their gods and heroes
without some good motive.</p>

<p>In the legend of Endymion the Greek language supplies
all that is needed to make it intelligible, but there are
many instances of the difficulty, or even the impossibility
of explaining certain Greek names by the help of Greek
only; since a name is not converted into a myth until its
original meaning has become obscured in the language
which gave it birth, though still perfectly comprehensible
in another of the same family, it behoves the classical
philologist to surrender all etymological researches of this
nature to the comparative philologist, whose privilege it is
to seek to discover the signification of a Greek word by
confronting it with contemporary witnesses from the
German, Celtic, or Sanscrit. In the Teutonic languages,
for instance, day has several names which are derived
from the root <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">dah</i>, to burn, to be hot; and this same root
has also given rise to the Greek name for dawn. In
Sanscrit it is called Ahana, from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ahan</i> or <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dahan</i>, the root
of which is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ah</i>; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dah</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dahan</i> may have lost their
initial <em>d</em>, or this letter may have been added to the root
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ah</i>; these gains and losses are met with frequently.</p>

<p>The Sanscrit name Ahana, known before Greek and
Sanscrit became separated, occurs but once in a hymn of
the Rig-Veda; in India this mythological germ withered
away, and even the name Ahana would not have survived,
but for this single verse which saved it from oblivion; but<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
it developed into a splendid growth in Greece, in the legend
of Eos, which I have quoted.</p>

<p>In this hymn addressed to Ushas we read: “We have
crossed the frontier of this darkness; Ahana shining forth
gives light, lighting up all the world, awakening mortals
to walk about&mdash;she received praise from every thinker.”
Ahana rises from the head of Dyu, the forehead of the
sky; she shows herself in the east, she advances and
awakens the sleepers. In Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">budh</i> means to wake
and to know, but light in Sanscrit has again a double
meaning, and means knowledge, much more frequently and
distinctly than light; this explains how Ahana, in awakening
mortals, causes persons to know.</p>

<p>The stories of Daphne and of Ahana are closely allied,
and the one explains the other. As long as we remain
ignorant of the fact that at first Daphne and Aurora were
one, this myth is inexplicable; but turn the name Ahana
into Greek, and you have the Dawn in the features of a
nymph loved by Apollo, and dying when the bright sun
touched her with his rays.</p>

<p>But why, it may be asked, was Daphne supposed to
have been changed into a laurel-tree? The dawn was
called daphne, the burning; so was the laurel&mdash;as wood
that burns easily, and whose flame throws a bright light&mdash;two
different objects, but alike under one aspect, though
two distinct acts. The root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dah</i> is found in daphne for
laurel equally with Daphne, dawn, the synonymy of the
two names producing the myth of Daphne. Although this
legend first came to life on Greek soil, it would have been
unintelligible without the help of the Veda, as the later
Sanscrit supplied no key to it.</p>

<p>The Sanscrit root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ah</i> is also the germ of the name of
Athena, the termination of the name corresponding to
Ahana; Athene is said to spring from the head of Zeus.
This extraordinary birth, though post-Homeric, is no doubt
of ancient date, since it repeats exactly the birth of Ahana.<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
The Hellenists maintain that the Greeks were unconscious
that the word Athene meant the dawn; doubtless few
amongst them knew that Zeus originally meant the surface
or forehead of the sky. It is also true that when the
people of Athens worshipped Athene as their tutelary
deity, she became something very different from the Indian
Ushas; but if we notice carefully all the many and various
ideas concerning this Greek goddess, we shall be led to
the supposition that her cradle was no other than that of
the dawn, namely, the east, the forehead of the sky, or
Zeus. Neither in the Veda, nor in Homer, is there any
mention of the mother of the dawn, although both mention
<em>her parents</em>.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that in the mythology of Italy,
Minerva, who was identical with Athene, should from the
beginning have assumed a name apparently expressive of
the intellectual rather than the physical character of the
Dawn-goddess. Minerva or Menerva is clearly connected
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens</i>, the Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">menos</i>, the Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">manas</i>, mind;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mane</i> in Latin is morning; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manare</i> is specially used
of the rising sun; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">matuta</i>, another name of the same
category, is the Dawn. The root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man</i>, which in all Aryan
languages means thought, was at a very early time, like
the Sanscrit <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">budh</i>, destined to express the revived consciousness
of the whole of nature at the approach of the
light of the morning. The equation Ahane = Athene is
both phonetically and mythologically irreproachable, the
correlative Minerva can also be explained mythologically.</p>

<p>To reject the explanations of these myths which Comparative
Philology furnishes, it would be necessary to prove
that Ahana and Eos do not mean the dawn, that Athene
does not correspond with Ahana, and that Helios is not
the sun.</p>

<p>Mythologists have sometimes failed to discover the
primitive character of certain myths, because they have
not looked beyond the Greek etymology. The word<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
Erinnys, “hovering in the gloom,” corresponds exactly to
the Sanscrit Saranyû = “break of day.” Poets sometimes
speak of the Dawn as avenging the crimes committed in
the dark; the myth of Erinnys denotes this same idea.
Instead of our lifeless and abstract expression, “A crime
is sure to be discovered,” the old proverbial and poetical
saying amongst the Greeks and Hindoos was, Erinnys&mdash;Saranyû,
“will bring misdeeds to light.” At first this
phrase was free from all mythological taint, but it was
afterwards transformed into a myth by the Greeks, as they
were ignorant of the true signification of the name of
Erinnys.</p>

<p>When the mythology of Greece fails to furnish an
explanation of many of the Greek phrases, because it
belongs to a later date than the classical period, the Veda
may then be questioned, and will supply us with the
information, by disclosing an ancient substratum of human
thought, such as existed amongst the inhabitants of one of
the most important regions of the world, India. It is
with as much pleasure as assurance that we repeat to those
learned scholars, who decline to open their eyes in order
to see, or see only what they consider should be there, the
Brahmanic saying, “It is not the fault of the post that
the blind man passes it without noticing it.”</p>

<p>It seems astonishing that a people so richly endowed as
the Greeks should have found pleasure in romancing so
constantly concerning the sun and the moon, the day and
the night, the dawn and the twilight; but the custom of
repeating these mythological phrases, which much resembled
each other, dated from an epoch before the Greeks, when
nothing more powerfully attracted and fascinated the
imagination of man than the aspect of nature’s forces,
especially the return of the sun, bringing with it each
morning light and heat and life. Repeated thus incessantly
these phrases became idiomatic, and were retold long after
the thread connecting them with the simple facts of nature<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
was broken and lost to memory. At first some old grandmother
would repeat them, partly understanding them in
their true natural sense, and partly metaphorically; the
sons of the old people would repeat them with a partial
understanding; but the grandsons would relate them only
for their peculiarities, or for the charm of their style and
setting; and the great-grandchildren would hand them on
at random, with no comprehension of their meaning. At
a much later period when all these sayings, with no connection
between them, had become traditional, the poets
would embody them in verse, giving them their first form
and permanence in a cycle of legends. They congratulated
themselves on the treasure-trove, but marvelled that the
Greeks should enclose these bald phrases of perpetual
iteration in the casket of their literature. They might
as well ask why the Greeks apparently sanctioned all the
irregular verbs their language holds by retaining them in
their grammar. Is it not a historical fact that cannot be
denied that the whole Aryan peoples, without exception,
have conserved as the heritage of their common origin not
only the names of their divinities, their legends, and their
folk-lore, but also remains of their primitive language.
Here is a noteworthy statement. Comparative Philology
has proved that there is nothing really irregular in a
language, and that what was formerly considered so in
declensions and conjugations is the stratum on which the
edifice of each language raised itself progressively. This
same apparent irregularity is found also in mythology,
because it is itself only a sort of dialect or offshoot of
language.</p>

<p>Since the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of myths, as such, is a forgetfulness
of the original sense of the words, we cannot hope
to be able to explain all the mythological recitals; no
one has more clearly stated the difficulty, nor expressed it
with greater modesty, than he who has laid the most
lasting foundation of comparative mythology. Grimm<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
says: “I shall indeed interpret all that I can, but I
cannot interpret all that I should like.”<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In examining these archives, which, if only on account
of their antiquity, are very superior to any other evidence
for our purpose, we learn that identification differs from
comparison. It is only possible to identify two or more
divinities by seeing if one name applies equally to all,
and by showing that this name denotes the essence of
each; this result is obtained when, for instance, we note
a general resemblance between a god or a hero of the
Veda, and a god or hero of Hesiod, and discover that
though their names may be phonetically dissimilar, yet that
they have one source. Uranus, in the language of Hesiod,
is used as a name for the sky&mdash;“a firm place for the
blessed gods”; and the poet says that Uranus covers
everything, and that when he brings the night he is
stretched out, everywhere embracing the earth. This
sounds like a reproduction of the name of Varuna, which
is derived from a root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Var</i>, to cover (the Sanscrit term
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">varutra</i>, overcoat, would prove this if need be). The
name Uranus in the Greek apparently retains something
of its primitive meaning, which is not the case with the
name of Zeus and Apollo. Varuna and Uranus evidently
both express the same mythological concept, that of the
covering, enclosing sky; this may even be one of the most
ancient discoveries of comparative mythology. In the
same way we prove that Ushas, Eos, Daphne, Ahana, and
Athene were five names of the dawn, and that they can
be traced back to a time before Greek and Sanscrit were
separated. Thus, whilst one legend becomes differentiated
from another by its own peculiar form and attributes, the
name of its original prototype remains etymologically the
same, though taking varying forms amongst the various
peoples who use the legend; it is in this immutable
name that the continuity of ideas lies, which nothing<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
obliterates, and which traverses the centuries, and connects
the mythologies of countries as totally distinct as India,
Greece, and Ireland. But we must remember that all
that is taken for etymology is not always so; the explanations
which Homer gives of the names of the
divinities only proves that at his time the original
meaning had been forgotten. To us who now know
the true principles of mythology, it is clear that it
represents a prehistoric period of language, and the light it
throws on the times that followed, has the same importance
with regard to the study of the human mind, that geology
and paleontology have for the knowledge of the earth.</p>

<p>Sometimes we come upon difficulties of another kind
when we seek to translate the language of the poets into
our modern forms of thought and speech. In consequence
of the absence of merely auxiliary words in mythological
language, each word, whether noun or verb, had its full
original power, it was heavy and unwieldy, it said
more than it ought to say. Here is an example:
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Nyx</i> (night), the mother of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Moros</i> (fate), of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ker</i> (destruction),
of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Thanatos</i> (death), of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Hypnos</i> (sleep), and
of the <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Oneïroi</i> (dreams), and these,&mdash;her progeny, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Night</i>
is said, by the poet, to have borne without a father.
She has also other children: <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Momos</i> (blame), <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Oizys</i> (woe),
the <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Hesperides</i>, which are the evening stars, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Nemesis</i>
(vengeance), <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Apate</i> (fraud), <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Philotes</i> (lust), <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Geras</i> (old age),
and <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Eris</i> (strife). Now let us use our modern expressions.
“The stars are seen as the night approaches,” “we sleep,
we dream, we die,” “we run into danger during night,”
“nightly revels lead to strife, angry discussions, and woe,”
“many nights bring old age, and at last death,” “an evil
deed concealed at first by the darkness of night will at last
be revealed by the day,” “night herself will be revenged on
the criminal”; and we have translated the language of
Hesiod, a language to a great extent understood by the
people to whom it was addressed many hundreds of years<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
ago, and it is made comprehensible to us by the addition
of some auxiliary words. This is hardly mythological
language, but rather a poetical and proverbial kind of
expression known to all poets whether modern or ancient,
and frequently to be found in the language of common
people when it becomes proverbial.</p>

<p>“In Greece the mortal element, inherent in all gods,
was eliminated to a great extent by the conception of
heroes. Whatever was too human in the ancient legends
told of Zeus and Apollo was transferred to so-called half gods
or heroes, who were represented as the sons or favourites
of the gods. The two-fold character of Herakles as a god
and as a hero is acknowledged even by Herodotus, and
some of his epithets would have been sufficient to indicate
his solar and originally divine character. But in order to
make some of the legends told of the solar deity possible
or conceivable, it was necessary to represent Herakles as a
more human being, and to make him rise to the seat of
the immortals only after he had endured toils and sufferings
incompatible with the dignity of an Olympian god.”<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The divinities of a second and third order, who were sometimes
solicited for special favours, were perhaps placed in
the same category as some provincial or local saints, who
were considered more accessible and more pitiful in certain
places, just as some physicians make a practice of curing
those ills only of which they had made a speciality.</p>

<p>There were also abstract divinities, representing certain
virtues in the eyes of the people, which were highly
esteemed and useful to possess; each of these qualities
which were conceived separately, and considered in the
superlative degree, were from that time raised to the rank
of a divine person, thus altars and temples were dedicated
to Courage, Strength, and Piety; Fame was likewise thus
honoured. “Great Fame is never lost though scattered
abroad,” said Hesiod, “it is in itself a divinity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>The language of mythology was in use at a late period.
History tells us that the Greek town of Cyrene in Libya
was founded about the thirty-seventh Olympiad, the ruling
race came from Thessaly; the foundation of the colony
was due to the oracle of Apollo at Pytho. This simple
historical fact has been thus rendered, from the habit of
not recounting events as they happened. “The heroic
maid Cyrene, who lived in Thessaly, was loved by Apollo,
and carried off to Libya.”</p>

<p>The question has been often asked, what can be the
origin of the fables which are identical in character and
form, whether we find them on Indian, Greek, Italian,
Persian, Slavonic, Celtic, or Teutonic soil. Was there a
period of temporary insanity, through which the human
mind had to pass, and was it a madness identically the same
in the south of India and in the north of Ireland? The
necessity of solving this problem became more imperative
when collections of these ancient traditions were brought
from countries which formerly were almost unknown to us;
incredible tales came from all parts, from amongst the
Hottentots, the Patagonians, Zulus, Esquimaux, and
Mongols; in all cases we were able to recognise the fables
with which we were already so well acquainted, from
having seen them in Aryan literature. When Max Müller
first published his essays on the Greek myths, the mythologists
acknowledged generally that it was very natural he
should devote so much time to the explanation of the
Greek legends, since these same stories had been universally
found in all parts of the globe, from the one pole
to the other; stories of men and women turned into trees,
trees transformed into men, men behaving as animals,
animals talking as if they were men, men swallowed by
gods and brought up again whole, as were the children of
Kronos; in all places the same adventures were told of
the sun and moon, also swallowed, but the swallower not
known. The Greek myths&mdash;so it was asserted by the<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
learned who did not care to abandon the old paths&mdash;form
only one page of that vast mythology created by the disordered
imagination of nations in their infancy; the
epidemic was general, and it is useless to seek for a
definite or peculiar meaning in such and such a local
myth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in presence of these striking likenesses,
impartial and clear-sighted science recognised that there
must be something in the human mind that of necessity
tended to mythology, nay, that there must be some reason
in all the unreason that goes by the name of myth. That
“something” Max Müller discovered to be language, in its
natural progress from roots to words, up to definite and
special names. Mythology has now been acknowledged to be
an inevitable phase in the growth of language and thought;
a form of expression which changes non-personal beings
into personal, and all relationships into actions; it is a
mental phenomenon so peculiar that it would be difficult
to avoid the admission that it emanated from a distinct
stratum, it is metaphoric language and thought; and it is
the duty of the geologist of language to establish the
authenticity of this epoch of organic life in humanity,
which is contemporaneous with the most ancient forms of
language.</p>

<p>If Hegel compares the discovery of the common origin of
Greek and Sanscrit to that of a new world, the same may be
said with regard to the common origin of all the mythologies,
for already the science of Comparative Mythology has risen
to the same importance as Comparative Philology.</p>

<p>The supposition that grammatical gender of nouns must
necessarily be the cause of personification, and produce
myths which had no previous existence at the time when
this denotation of sex did not yet exist, has been proved
incorrect. But the following fact, which concerns language
more than mythology, is not so evident at first sight, viz.,
that however the various languages may differ externally,<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
and however they may lack gender, yet they have without
exception what is analogous to it, and takes its place; this
is a system of fundamental classification to which all
equally submit, and which each language supplies; the
result is that at the foundation of thought common to all
humanity, certain forms are found answering the purpose
of gender. Each myth and each legend was at first the
intelligible expression of an intelligible thought, and as
the thought contained in each recital must evidently be
the same wherever there were men to repeat it, the
science of Comparative Mythology seeks to place its hand
on the expression which best renders this one and the selfsame
thought, under different aspects.</p>

<p>What is commonly called Hindoo mythology is of little
or no avail for comparative purposes, because nothing is
systematically arranged. Names are used in one hymn of
the Rig-Veda as appellatives, in another as names of gods.
There are as yet no genealogies, and no recorded marriages
between gods and goddesses. As the conception of the
poet varied, so varied the nature of these gods; the myths
are arranged with little order. Nowhere is the wide
distance which separates the ancient poems of India from
the most ancient literature of Greece more clearly felt
than when we compare the growing myths of the Veda
with the full-grown, or already decaying myths on which
the poetry of Homer is founded. The Veda is the real
theogony of the Aryan races, while that of Hesiod is a
copy only of the original image. The Hindoo Rishis
differed much amongst themselves in their representation
of things; some of them attributed the dispersion of
clouds by a solar hero, to the will of some supreme
or divine being; others considered the combatants to be
the supreme beings themselves, who dispersed the clouds
full of lightning and thunder, making the sky serene after
the fight. These are the two distinct interpretations of
the solar and atmospheric schools; the dualism in nature,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
which at a later period took the character of light and
darkness, even of good and evil, was at the beginning the
dualism of day and night, spring and winter, life and
death, represented by the two great luminaries of the
physical world.</p>

<p>The characteristic traits of the moon which made the
deepest impression on our ancestors were its increase, and
afterwards its gradual diminution, until its total disappearance.
The eclipses, though filling the minds of the people
with sudden fear at first, did not continue long to awaken
dread or curiosity, as they were of rare occurrence and
transitory; the moon, it was thought, was swallowed and
afterwards disgorged by some hostile power; but the
monthly increase and diminution required some other
explanation. The Hindoos, in seeking to discover the
abode of the gods and of their own ancestors, assigned the
brilliant sky to the former, and where, therefore, should
the Fathers live if not in the vast vault and in the moon?
This was, in fact, the belief of the whole Aryan race. But
the subject is complicated, since in an earlier period of
lunar mythology, we find in the Vedic Pantheon a divinity
of the name of Soma, which certain poets identify with
the plant of that name, whose intoxicating juice played an
important part in the sacrifices; there is no doubt a great
obscurity with regard to these two rival powers, to which
the same name had been given, and on which mythologists
have found it difficult to enlighten us; but quite recently
exponents of the Rig-Veda have discovered that Soma
originally meant the moon itself, thus the Rishis allow it
to be apparent in their hymns that there were at one time
two Somas&mdash;the plant and its juice, and at an earlier
period the other Soma, known only to the old Brahmans,
which was the moon. A belief held by the Hindoos was
that the moon supplied nourishment to the gods, which
was the cause of the diminution; its increase was explained
by the entrance into it of the souls of their ancestors; the<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
gods swallowing these also as an integral portion of the
moon.</p>

<p>All these ideas were of slow development, and of successive
growth; no portion of mythology had a systematic
elaboration.</p>

<p>I will add as a curious scientific fact, that lately
botanists have sought in vain in Northern India and in
Persia for a plant whose qualities correspond to those of
the Soma as described in the Vedic hymns; they are
more or less agreed that it must be akin to the <em>Ephedra</em>,
but as this plant abounded in the whole country between
Siberia and the Iberian Peninsula, there was no hope of
discovering the locality of the Aryans by means of the
habitat of the plant.</p>

<p>It has been often asserted that these stories of men
and things that have been swallowed must have come
from countries formerly inhabited by cannibals; learned
writers, even Herbert Spencer&mdash;to quote one instance&mdash;consider,
not without some appearance of reason, that
Hindoos, Greeks, Romans and Germans could hardly have
put forth similar stories of this kind had there been no
foundation in fact. But the verbs to eat, to swallow, will
admit of divers interpretations; we say of a man that it
was impossible for him to swallow such an insult, or that
he has consumed his fortune; and this mode of speech
surprises no one; where we speak of an eclipse, the inhabitants
of the shores of the Baltic say that the moon or
sun is in the act of being eaten; in India instead of
saying such an one has been flogged, it would be said, he
has tasted the whip. A little reflection will convince us
that if nations who had nothing in common but human
nature, spoke of the night as covering, hiding, swallowing
various beings, especially the sun and the day, it was not
more unreasonable on their part than to say, as we do,
that day and night follow each other, instead of expressing
ourselves after a more scientific manner, and not less<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
correctly, in saying that day and night are the successive
effects of the rotation of the earth on its axis.</p>

<p>Having discovered that mythological phraseology was
sometimes due to misconceptions of names, and that
poetical fantasies had their share, philologists quoted an
instance of the imagination being misled by a simple
mistake; that of the name “Great Bear” being given to
a certain group of stars. The Sanscrit root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ark</i> signified
to brighten, to praise, to glorify, to celebrate; man
praised, glorified, celebrated the sun, moon and stars; for
these purposes the word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ark</i> was used. For all we know
the substantive <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">rik</i> may really have conveyed all these
meanings during the earliest period of the Aryan
language; but if we look at the fully developed branches
of that family of speech, we find that in this, its simplest
form, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">rik</i> has been divested of all meaning in the Rig-Veda
except one; it only means a song of praise, a hymn,
that gladdens the heart of man, and brightens the
countenance of the gods. The other words, however,
which rik might have expressed were not entirely given
up, but the root was rendered more definite; thus <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">arki</i>
and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">arkis</i> were formed, these no longer meant hymns of
praise, but light, ray. It is difficult to understand how
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Riksha</i>, in the sense of bright, has become the name of
“the bear”; might it not be on account of his brilliant
tawny fur, or from his bright eyes? No one knows. Certain
it is that in Sanscrit bears were called <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Riksha</i>. But the
word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Riksha</i> had also another meaning, as shown by a
passage in the Rig-Veda 1, 24, 10. “These stars (riksha)
fixed high above, which are seen by night; whither did
they go by day?” The Commentator observed that the
word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">riksha</i> is not used in the sense of stars in general,
but that according to tradition the name is only given to
that particular constellation, which in later Sanscrit is
called “the Seven Rishis,” or “the Seven Sages.” And
thus it happened that when the dispersion took place,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
and the Aryans left their primitive home and settled in
Europe, they ceased to use the plural form “<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Arktoi</i>,” or
many bears, and spoke of the group of seven stars as the
Bear, the Great Bear, without knowing why these stars
had originally received that name.</p>

<p>It did not escape the notice even of the less erudite
that the gods of Greece and Rome and of other Aryan
nations had a close connection with the most striking
phenomena of nature; they also recognised the same
origin amongst the divinities of the Semitic nations, as
well as those of Egypt, Africa and America; this could,
of course, be accounted for by the presence of the same
primitive stratum of human thought, resembling those
deeper geological layers, which only show themselves in a
partial and fragmentary manner.</p>

<p>But none of these mythologists attached the least importance
to the <em>names</em> of the divinities, and if they were
told that they were nothing but names, it sounded almost
like heresy to them, and they ignored the fact that one of
the latest scientific discoveries was being submitted to
them. Yet it is indubitable that the sun and the moon
were in the places occupied by them at present before
they were named; but not till they were named was
there a Savitar, a Helios, a Selene or a Mene. If then
it is the name which makes the gods in mythology,
in enabling us to distinguish one from another, it
follows that we must call the Science of Language to our
aid in order to solve the problem of mythology, since
that alone discloses the causes which have despoiled the
names of their primitive meaning, and that alone shows
how the germs of decrepitude, inherent in language, affect
both the phonetic portion and also the signification of
words, since words naturally react on thought and mould it.</p>

<p>The habit which I have contracted of living in the society
of our ancestors of prehistoric times, would, it might be
thought, naturally cause me to notice the dissimilarities
between us and them rather than the likenesses; this
often happens, but not always. Our fathers, for instance,
did not know the thousandth part of our vocabulary,
which is very copious; this would seem to indicate
that our knowledge has considerably increased in the
course of thirty or forty centuries. Words of deep import
are familiar to us; who amongst us does not know and
use such as these&mdash;Law, Necessity, Liberty, Spirit, Matter,
Conscience, Belief, Nature, Providence, Revelation, Inspiration,
the Soul, Religion, Infinite, Immortality, and
many others, which are either of recent origin, or have
become new because their meaning has changed? Here
the difference between our fathers and ourselves springs
into sight.</p>

<p>But the points of resemblance are still more striking.</p>

<p>Long before our present era, certain philosophers
asserted that their world was full of gods, we may say
with equal truth that God fills our world; His name is in
every mouth, and our little children know it well. Moreover
the complete identity between certain mental acts of
our fathers and our own is easily recognised. Our fathers
were satisfied not to enquire concerning the nature of
their gods, they knew their names, and that sufficed. We
too have become accustomed to hear God’s name repeated
frequently, without always questioning ourselves as to its<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
meaning, and in what way He has made the earth His
habitation.</p>

<p>To talk of what we do not grasp must be essentially
human, since we find the practice in two social conditions,
separated from each other by thousands of years.</p>

<p>It is incredible to what a point we of the nineteenth
century carry our lack of enquiry. If one day we were to
count on our fingers the number of interesting subjects we
had allowed to pass by us without any interrogations concerning
them, fifty hands would not suffice us for the tale;
our ignorance would then become apparent. Should we
feel humiliated? In all probability no, for before arriving
at this much to be desired consummation, we should have
been carried away by many thoughts in no way bearing on
the subject, and the one thought which would come prominently
to the front and hinder us from passing our
conduct in review would be, “I see no necessity to apply
myself to them.” In fact, nothing is easier and nothing
so reposeful to our mind as acquiescence in the popular
opinion, which we allow to guide us in our estimation of
words and phrases; as so frequently happens with ourselves
(by “ourselves” I mean that very considerable
portion of society which separates the working classes from
the savants and philosophers).</p>

<p>“All things are full of the gods,” was said by the
heathen in former days; and in fact divinities abounded;
this was not surprising. “God has chosen to Himself a
people and spread His name over the whole earth, and to
make His will to be known,” as we say now. Thus we
know that God is, and that His commandments must be kept.</p>

<p>To consider words as ideas is not wise. Why do we
not imitate the savages who when they hear an organ for
the first time have a great desire to open it in order to see
what is inside; and we who are civilised play with much
light-hearted readiness on the gigantic instrument of
language without seeking to know the value of the sounds<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
we draw from it; and the names of beings and objects
which should exercise the most powerful influence to
which moral things can be subjected, are treated as mere
sounds.</p>

<p>Have we asked ourselves the meaning of the word God?
Many must answer no to this question. This is not well,
in spite of the fact that those who have asked it in this
form have not always succeeded in obtaining an answer;
no one has formed a complete conception of God, since
neither sense nor reason is equal to the task. Plato,
although named “Divine” by the ancient philosophers
and by Christian theologians, did not like to speak of
<em>The Gods</em>, but replacing the plural by the singular used
the word “Divine,” but he did not explain what he understood
by this word. Plato certainly mentions the Creator
of the Universe, the Father of humanity, but&mdash;“he does not
tell His name, for he knew it not; he does not tell His
colour, for he said it not; he does not tell His size, for he
touched it not.”<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Xenophanes, who lived 300 years before
Plato, said, “There is one God, the greatest amongst gods
and men; neither in form nor in thought like unto
mortals.”<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The Greek philosophers protested against all attempts
to apply a name which should be adequate to the Supreme
Being; since all the words chosen failed to grasp His
essence, and only designated certain sides and points of
view, predicting of Him whatever was most beautiful in
nature. For this reason early Christian writers who were
Greeks rather than Jews, who had studied in the schools
of Plato and Aristotle, spoke of God in the same abstract
language, the same negative terms; they said, “We cannot
call Him Light, since Light is His creation; we cannot
call Him Spirit, since the Spirit is His breath; nor
Wisdom, since Wisdom emanates from Him; nor Force,
since Force is the manifestation of His Power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>Thus instead of saying what God is, the philosophers,
heathen as well as Christian, prefer to say what He is not.
But in that case what idea could man form of a Being
whom the wisest amongst them could not represent or
describe? Do we understand the nature of this Supreme
Being better by using the name so well known of Providence?
Again no; since we have introduced several
meanings into this word which are inconsistent the one
with the other. Amongst them there might well be some
that are erroneous, which would thus lead us to rest our
hopes on false foundations.</p>

<p>This mist, hiding from us the meaning of words and
obscuring our ideas, is partly owing to a fault committed
by the ancients themselves.</p>

<p>When our ancestors communed with their divinities,
they did not ask themselves what the names they pronounced
really meant; in invoking Varuna, Helios,
Athene, Prithvi, and the others, they were satisfied, at
least for the time being, since names possess a strange
calming property; this unquestioning acquiescence has
been bequeathed to us. We are neither more enquiring,
more exact, nor more pedantic than the greater part of our
ancestors; we speak of angels, for instance, without seeking
to fathom their nature, much in the same way as we might
mention lords and dukes without troubling ourselves to
reflect that the one means “bread-giver” and the other
“dux,” or one capable of being a leader of men.</p>

<p>In speaking of the soul, the immortality of the soul,
and of religion, we use words which have become common
property, and it is not necessary to analyse them in order
to feel sure that they represent things which are very
real; still we do not strive to understand what these
things really are. Thus it happens that words whose
meaning is unknown to us or escapes us, are generally
those of which we make daily use; we keep to
the impression received of them in our childhood, or<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
accepted by current opinion, or with which sentiment
invests them, but this is unsatisfactory; we should feel
ashamed of not possessing more accurate knowledge
than this of geography or arithmetic. On the other
hand, there are scientific terms which seem to us so
technical that we willingly abandon their use to experts,
and yet their meaning can be readily and definitely
grasped.</p>

<p>What meaning, for instance, has the word <em>infinite</em> for
us, even if taken in its most simple acceptation; this
<em>infinite</em> towards which our thoughts travel when we raise
our eyes to the skies? Astronomers say to us, “Look at
something greater than the greatest possible greatness,
that is the infinitely great.” They then quote figures, but
these figures of infinite greatness elude our imagination,
we repeat them mechanically and only out of respect to
the high scientific authority who guarantees the accuracy
of the calculations or the value of the appreciation.</p>

<p>A small object, apparently of the size of a homeopathic
globule, moves in space, it contains our continents and our
oceans, this globule moves in company with other globules
of the same nature.</p>

<p>Astronomers speak to us of the millions of miles
separating us from the sun, yet this distance dwindles
down to nothing as compared with the nearest star, which,
we are told, lies twenty millions of millions of miles from
our earth. Another stupendous thought is that a ray of
light traverses space at the rate of 187,000 miles in a
second, and yet it requires three years to reach us.</p>

<p>But this is only a small matter.</p>

<p>More than one thousand millions of such stars have
been discovered by our telescopes, and there may be
millions of millions of suns within our siderial system
which are as yet beyond the reach of our best telescopes;
even that siderial system need not be regarded as single
within the universe, thousands of millions of similar<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
systems may be recognised in the galaxy or milky
way.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Now let us turn our eyes to the infinitely little. One
drop of water taken from the ocean contains atoms so
small that a grain of the finest dust would seem colossal
by the side of them; chemists are now able to ascertain
the relative positions of atoms so minute that millions of
them can stand upon a needle’s point.</p>

<p>All this we gather from science when&mdash;working together
with the telescope&mdash;it investigates space; and this may
still be little compared to what we might see through
glasses, which should magnify objects some millions of
times more than our best instruments.</p>

<p>The infinite in space has engaged the attention of many
thinkers; I will quote from two only, as this infinite,
which they studied from different points of view, yet
suggests thoughts somewhat alike. Kepler, the discoverer
of the laws on which our planetary system is based, said,
“My highest wish is to find <em>within</em> the God whom I have
found everywhere <em>without</em>.” Kant, the philosopher, to
whom the Divine in nature and the Divine in man
appeared as transcendent and beyond our cognisance, and
who refused to listen to any theological argument tending
to prove the existence of God, yet says, “Two things fill
me with new and ever growing admiration and awe: the
starry firmament above me, and the moral law within me;
neither of them is hidden in darkness, I see them both
before me, and I connect them directly with the consciousness
of my own existence.”<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>These are very abstract thoughts; and it is pertinent to
notice that the most solemn religious terms, and the
most striking expressions of admiration, and poetical
phrases of love, have their source in verbal roots, indicative
of acts and conditions palpable to the senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>But I am approaching too closely to matters of high
import. I am drawn by the word <em>Infinite</em>. Aristotle
said truly, “the Infinite attracts.” He was thinking of
that other infinite, which is not the one intended by
astronomers; but for myself the infinite in nature captivates
me so powerfully that I find it difficult to touch
earth again. Let us walk in beaten paths; let us
endeavour to grasp the meaning of the more simple
words learnt mechanically at school, such as those denoting
abstraction as well as nouns, and terms both general
and particular; and let us see to what phase of thought
and speech these grammatical exercises will carry us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each palpable object is known to us according as it
affects our senses, that is to say, by its properties; all
impalpable objects cannot be known otherwise than by
their qualities; but nothing exists in nature, whether
palpable or impalpable, that has only one property or one
quality, each object has several; an object as it exists in
reality is concrete, and has a concrete name. If we wished
to consider only one of its attributes, we should have to
take that apart and isolate it, in order to fix our thoughts
exclusively on that; “we must drop that of which the
attributes are attributes.”<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> We see white snow, white
chalk, white milk, we have the sensation of the white
colour; but to take whiteness apart from the snow, the
chalk, and the milk, is an operation which requires an
instrument, a means, this we possess in a word, viz., the
word <em>white</em>. Without that word we should have the
sensation of whiteness, but not the idea; it is the word
<em>white</em>, whilst separating the white colour from the snow,
the chalk, and the milk, that gives us the abstract idea as
well as the abstract term whiteness. This mental act is
called <em>abstraction</em>: and it is by this process of abstraction<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
that we really arrive at the true knowledge of anything,
apart from the sensation of it only.</p>

<p>Here is another example of abstraction. Let us suppose
that two persons are in one room, and that there are in the
room two windows, two doors, two tables and two chairs.
Let us try to obliterate in our mind the persons, the
windows, the doors, the tables and the chairs; nothing
now remains but the abstraction <em>two</em>. Now <em>two</em>, as such,
apart from objects, does not exist in nature; still it
is a conception we can retain in our mind, and this abstract
idea can be incorporated in the abstract word <em>two</em>.</p>

<p>These two examples of abstraction tell us but little of
what is meant by it; and although they teach us
little of the part abstraction plays in our mental life, they
are correct from a logical point of view, and clearly
demonstrate the impossibility of retaining a thought apart
from the word expressing it, since evidently the representation
of <em>two</em> and of <em>whiteness</em> could not have been
made if the words had been lacking.</p>

<p>The faculty of abstraction has no doubt taken time to
develop in man, and the absence of abstract words and
consequently of abstract ideas was complete in primitive
man as it now is in our very young children. The faculties
of brutes can by no means attain to abstraction. One
reason, amongst others, why we have no ground to think
brutes have abstract general ideas is that they do not
speak, that they have no use of the words without which
it is impossible to carry out the operation which I have
just described, and to cause a conception to arise from a
sensation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, in our early days, our parents gave us instruction
on the three divisions of natural history, and explained to
us of what they consisted, we did not suspect that a period of
immense length had elapsed before man succeeded in thus
skilfully classifying the vast mass of names in the<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
manner which struck us as so natural and inevitable.
Many thousands of objects were before us, each one
entitled to bear an expressive name; and in proportion as
our knowledge of things increased was science called
upon to furnish new terms; their name became legion
and memory failed to retain them. It therefore became
a necessity to classify the objects of a common nature
under one name; hence the evolution of the terms animal,
vegetable and mineral, which relieved us from the burden
of enumerating all the objects composing genus and
species; then in speaking of them to others we use the
generic term, which at the same time presents the image
to our own minds. Thus when we wish to denote men
having the same nationality as ourselves we employ the
collective term compatriot; in the same way the word
furniture includes all that serves to furnish our rooms.
By the help of this ingenious combination we relieve our
memories of a mass of encumbering words, we economise
our time and our powers, and simplify the machinery of
our thoughts.</p>

<p>This is evidently an advantage. But now a difficulty
presents itself. When employing these general terms,
such as vegetable, animal, the human race, we are speaking
of things of which we are ignorant, and are therefore for
us as if they had no existence. We cannot have a
complete knowledge of vegetables since that word comprehends
all plants and trees on the earth; neither of
animals, since “animal” includes not only all beasts
lacking reason but also man who is endowed with it.
We are equally ignorant of the human race, since it is
composed of all human creatures, past, present and to
come. It is evident that we only know individual persons
and things, such as this fir tree or that oak, this horse,
this cow, Paul or James, and we know them because we
are in a position to distinguish them by naming them, or
indicating them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>How is it that philosophers of the mental calibre
possessed by Locke, Hume and Berkeley&mdash;whose minds
follow so closely the progress of the perception of general
ideas&mdash;did not question how it was that terms which were
applicable to these ideas could equally well be applied to
particular things? What was the origin of the word
<em>man</em> that it could be as suitable for Paul or James as for
many men, in fact the whole human race? This is a fact
about which philosophers do not appear to have troubled
themselves, and which the science of language alone can
explain.</p>

<p>In the time of our primitive ancestors human knowledge
was evolved gradually from what was confused and vague,
before arriving at what was deemed settled and distinct.
Man’s vocabulary was small, substantives were rare; that
which we now understand by garden, courtyard, field,
habitation, was merged into one and the same conception,
and would be expressed by one vocable, of which the
modern equivalent is enclosure; the word <em>serpent</em> designated
all creatures that crawled, the word <em>fruit</em> implied
all that could be eaten, the word <em>man</em> all who could think;
each name was a general term expressive of a general
idea.</p>

<p>We may remember that the Sanscrit word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sar</i>, to run,
which was at first used for rivers in general, became a
particular name; a demonstrative element joined to the
verb, changing it into <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sarit</i>, run here, sufficed at once to
turn it into an intelligible phrase, and the name of a
particular river. In order to form the word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man-u-s</i>,
man, the constructors of language combined the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man</i>,
measurer, thinker, in its secondary form <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man-u</i>, with the
suffix <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">s</i>, which gives the meaning think-here. This was
at first not of general application, but as it could be
repeated any number of times and referred each time to
different persons, who could each be named thinker-here,
it became a general term. We thus see that the name<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">manus</i> was from the beginning something more than a
mere conventional sign applied to a particular person as
are all proper names. It was a predicative name, that is
applicable to all possessing the same attributes, viz., of
being able to think, and capable of the same act, that of
thinking.</p>

<p>This discovery was followed by another not less unexpected.
When examining the oldest word for name, which
in Sanscrit is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nâman</i>, in Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">onoma</i>, in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>,
we find that it dates from a time when the Sanscrit,
Greek and Latin languages were all one; consequently
the English <em>name</em> and the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Name</i> are not as we
supposed, words invented by the ancient Saxons, but they
already existed before the separation of Teutonic idioms
from their elder brothers.</p>

<p>After some further steps our contemporary philologists
discovered the sources whence proceeded this Sanscrit
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nâman</i>; it is formed of the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nâ</i>, originally <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">gnâ</i>, to
know, joined to a suffix which generally expresses an
instrument, a means; <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">nâman</i> is the representative of
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">gnâman</i>, which we recognise in the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognomen</i>, the
consonant <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">g</i> being dropped as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">natus</i>, son, which was
formerly <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">gnatus</i>. This word <em>name</em> had at first a much
more extended meaning than that of a simple arbitrary
sign applied “to what we call a thing.” The constructors
of the word were aware of a fact of which consciousness
was afterwards lost, and which the learned ignored during
all the supervening centuries&mdash;viz., that all names, far
from being mere conventional signs used to distinguish
one thing from another, were meant to express what it
was possible to know of a thing; and that a name thus
places us in a position really to be cognisant of a thing.
A natural insight taught the early framers of our language
a truth only acquired by us after interminable researches,
such as Hegel expresses when saying, “We think in
words,” and which we find again in this somewhat<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
tautological expression “nominibus noscimus” = “tel
nom, telle notion.”</p>

<p>The fact that names, which are signs not of things, but
of particular concepts, are all derived from general ideas,
is one of the most fruitful discoveries of the science of
language; since it not only expresses the truth which has
been stated below, that language and the capability of
forming general ideas separate man from the animals, but
also a second truth that these two phenomena are two
sides of the same truth. This explains the reason why the
science of language rejects equally the interjectional theory
and the mimetic, but accepts the final elements of language,
those roots which all contain concepts.</p>

<p>The name man, which we all apply to ourselves, is a
title of nobility to which none other can compare. It is
the direct issue of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man</i>, which in its turn came from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mâ</i>,
to measure, this gave <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mâs</i>, moon, to the Sanscrit language.
The word man contains in itself the kernel of subtle
thought; if we connect the word with the celestial body
that helps us to measure our time, we do not therefore
necessarily invest the moon with a living and thinking
personality; it is sufficient to consider that if our ancestors
conceived of it as measuring the nights and days, they had
in themselves the capabilities with which they invested
the words they created.</p>

<p>We must also notice that the creators of this name
having connected it with the loftiest thing of which they
could conceive&mdash;thought&mdash;did not stop there; the sight
of what was lowest&mdash;the dust&mdash;inspired them with another
name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo</i> = earth-born; this Latin word having the same
source as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">humus</i> = the soil. Our fathers also gave themselves
a third name, which was <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">brotos</i> in Greek, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mortalis</i> in
Latin, and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">marta</i>&mdash;the dying&mdash;in Sanscrit; they could
hardly have applied the word mortal to themselves if they
had not at the same time believed in other beings who did
not die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>And this strange fact has come to pass, that on our
planet there existed in former days men&mdash;simple mortals
as they were&mdash;who manipulated thought, incorporating it
with language, the only domain in which it can exist;
then these marvellous men so entirely eclipsed themselves,
and passed out of our ken, that their posterity do not
recognise them under their modest garb of anonymity;
for their work though still living through thousands of
centuries, is so unrecognised that men ask themselves,
“Why is it not possible to think apart from words?”</p>

<p>Thus we acknowledge the profound wisdom of the conceptions
of our ancestors; but their understanding worked
unequally, on certain points it was very advanced, but on
others behindhand.</p>

<p>In following the march of human intellect in the past,
we are struck by the slowness with which thought and
speech co-operated. As long as our ancestors had no
occasion to speak of the action of covering a surface with
a liquid or soft substance, they did not possess the word
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">var</i> = to cover; “the name of colour in Sanscrit is
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">varna</i>, clearly derived from this word; and not till the
art of painting, in its most primitive form, was discovered
and named, could there have been a name for colour.”
For some time they continued to view various objects differently
coloured without distinguishing the tints; it is
well known that the distinction of colours is of late date;
our ancestors gazed on the blue sky, or the green trees, as
in a dream, without recognising blue or green, as long as
they lacked words to define the two colours, and some time
elapsed before they particularised the colours by giving
each its proper title.</p>

<p>We speak of the seven colours of the rainbow, because
the intermediate tints elude us; the ancients acted much
in the same way, Xenophanes speaks of the rainbow as a
cloud of purple, red, and yellow; Aristotle also speaks of
the tri-coloured rainbow, red, yellow, and green; and<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
Democritus seems only to have mentioned black, white
and yellow.</p>

<p>Does this indicate that our senses have gradually become
more acute and accurate? No, no one has asserted that
the sensitiveness of the organs of sense was less thousands
of years ago than it is now; the sensation has not
changed, but “we see in this evolution of consciousness of
colour how perception goes hand in hand with the evolution
of language, and how, by a very slow process, every
definite concept is developed out of an infinitude of
indistinct perceptions.”<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The names of colours have not been applied arbitrarily,
any more than the names given to divinities. Blue, for
instance, owes its origin to the visible results of violence,
or of an accident; the science of etymology shows us that
the Old Norse words, blár, blá, blatt, which now mean
blue, meant originally the livid colour of a bruise. Grimm
traces these words back to the Gothic <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bliggvan</i>, to strike;
and he quotes as an analogous case the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæsius</i>&mdash;a
bluish grey, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cædere</i>, to cut. If the assertion that
blue and green are rarely mentioned until a late date be
correct, it would follow that they had been worked out of
an infinity of colours before they took their place definitely
as the colour of the sky and the colour of the trees
and grass.</p>

<p>As we trace etymology to its source, we see how man’s
perception was confused at first. From the Sanscrit root
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ghar</i>, which has many different meanings, such as to heat,
to melt, to drip, to burn, to shine, come not only many
words&mdash;heat, oven, warmth, and brightness, but also the
names of many bright colours, all varying between yellow,
green, red, and white. But the most striking example is
afforded by the Sanscrit word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ak-tu</i>. Here we have the
first instance of the uncertainty in the meaning of the
names of colours which pervades all languages, and which<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
can be terminated at last by scientific definition only.
This word has two opposite meanings&mdash;a light tinge or
ray of light, and also a dark tinge, and night; this same
word in Greek, <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ak-tis</i>, means a ray of light. Thus,
whilst ideas are not definitely named, even the most
simple, such as those of white and black, are not realised;
philosophers have long known this, but the learned in
physical science seem only recently to have drawn attention
to the fact. Virchow was the first to make the following
assertion: “Only after their perceptions have
become fixed by language, are the senses brought to
a conscious possession and a real understanding of
them.”<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Surgeons have explained that the faculty of sight
proceeds from the movement of an unknown medium,
which in the case of light has been called ether, this
strikes the retina, and is conveyed to the brain by the
optic nerve; “but what relation there is between the
effect, namely, our sensation of red, and the cause, namely,
the 500 millions of millions of vibrations of ether in one
second, neither philosophy nor physical science has yet
been able to explain.”<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>We are able to picture to ourselves the difficulties
which assailed man in his efforts to express his impressions
in primitive times, since we find ourselves at times
struggling with the same difficulties, and there are
occasions when we struggle in vain, we do not conquer
the difficulty.</p>

<p>Sensations which are subjective and personal are of all
others the most difficult to define, since we lack words to
express what is from its nature purely personal; and yet
we have frequently occasion to mention them, how can we
best express ourselves? As the required word does not
seem forthcoming we have recourse to metaphor, and<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
almost unconsciously we use terms borrowed from external
phenomena connected with the sense of hearing, of smelling,
and of tasting, and which for the most part are acts or
conditions in the domain of the sense of sight. Our old
acquaintances the roots, whose meanings are to cut, to
pinch, to bite, to burn, to hit, to sting, to soften, having
formed the base of the adjectives sharp, sweet, keen,
burning, we use these to describe certain sensations. We
do not know how better to particularise a physical pain
than by comparing it to something that tears, cuts or
stings. But if certain physical ills, certain colour perceptions,
certain impressions of sharpness, sweetness and
heat experienced when tasting various foods find metaphorical
expression in external acts, there still remains a
whole category of simple ideas for which no words can be
found. There are certain sensations of taste which cannot
be expressed in words. Yesterday I ate a pear, to-day I
have eaten a peach; I am quite capable of distinguishing
the special flavour of each, but finding nothing in the
world of facts with which to compare them, I am without
words to apply to them, and it would be as impossible for
me to convey an idea of the flavour to any one who had
never eaten a pear or a peach as to make any person
understand if I spoke in a language which was unknown
to him.</p>

<p>Since all words that succeed in expressing our sensations
are drawn from external phenomena, we are in a
position to know the origin and historic past of these
words. But I cannot thus easily foresee even the near
future of some of these words. The sound of the clarionet
and that of the hautbois, the whistling of the wind, the
whisper of the waves, the yellow of the straw and that of
the lemon, the green of the emerald and the blue of the
sky, all characterise objects belonging to the material
world; but if these words: clarionet and hautbois, wind
and waves, straw and lemon, emerald and sky, which alone<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
enable us to define clearly to our minds certain sounds
and certain colours were lacking in our vocabulary, I do
not know how a musician could have composed a symphony,
or an artist painted his picture, although the
creation of both works of art proceeds equally from
personal inspiration invisible to the eye.</p>

<p>The tie that binds thought to speech has been alternately
acknowledged and forgotten; if Plato believed that
the origin of language was the imitation of the voices of
nature (an error which weighed heavily on humanity
during the space of two thousand years), he also knew
that words are indispensable to man for the very formation
of thought. Abelard was more explicit on this point,
he said: “Language is generated by the intellect, and
generates intellect.” Hobbes understood so well that
language was meant first of all for ourselves, and afterwards
only for others, that he calls words, as meant for
ourselves, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notæ</i>, and distinguishes them from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signa</i>, the
same words as used for the sake of communication, and
he added: “If there were only one man in the world
he would require <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notæ</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The close connection between
thought and speech cannot be more clearly or concisely
expressed.</p>

<p>This discovery makes its way slowly in the world,
because certain philosophers who have been rendered
immobile by tradition, darken counsel by their speculations.
Some of the Polynesians would seem to have a
far truer insight into the nature of thought and language
than these philosophers to whom I have made allusion;
they call thinking “speaking in the stomach,” which
means of course to speak inaudibly, and it is this absolutely
inarticulate speech which is so often mistaken for thought
without words; because the fact is ignored that <em>notion</em>
and <em>name</em> are two words for one thing. “It is certain,”
they say, “that a thought may be conceived in the mind,<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
but is formulated at a later period; for instance, if you
have to write a letter of no great importance, and which
affects you little, take your pen, and before the idea
appears to you completely clothed, your hand has passed
over the paper, and you proceed to read your ideas in the
words you see before you.” This is an illusion. We can
no doubt distinguish the written word from the word-concept,
but the former could not exist without the latter.
I defy our opponents to think of the most ordinary and
familiar object, such as a dog for instance, without saying
to themselves the word dog. They would explain that the
remembrance only of a special dog, or of its bark would
suffice to call up the image of the dog in their minds;
they do not see that the likeness of a dog, or the remembrance
of its bark is equivalent to the word dog, and that
they cannot possibly become conscious to themselves of
what they appear to be thinking, without having the word
in reserve in some part of themselves, either “in the
stomach,” as some savages say, or, as is more gracefully
expressed by the Italians, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in petto</i>.</p>

<p>Descartes was a learned Christian, who pondered for
some time over the questions whether the human mind
could be certain of anything without being supernaturally
enlightened; he resolved to prove it; and to this end he
imagined that he, Descartes, was certain of nothing&mdash;doubted
of all&mdash;even mathematical conclusions; he then
reflected on this position, and after a time the idea
occurred to him that as he was capable of reflection it
proved without a doubt that he, Descartes, existed, and
that consequently it was no longer possible to have doubts
of his own identity.</p>

<p>The portrait of this philosopher as depicted on the cover
of his works, represents him reclining in a chair thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;and
exclaiming, “Cogito ergo
sum.”</p>

<p>Those persons amongst us who are not specially interested<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
in any system of philosophy are certainly in the majority;
all know that such systems exist, and that they are noted,
but from the want of reflection, however little, some persons
look upon them as having sprung fully equipped, and in
their present form, from the brains of their founders. But
it would be incorrect, simply on the evidence of a frontispiece,
to consider these philosophical processes as thus
instantaneous. The systems of philosophy, even those of
small value, require much time for their elaboration, and
ripen slowly, and are never free from opposition. They
establish close links between the living thinkers of to-day,
and those who are no longer on earth. The philosophers of
the Middle Ages consulted those of antiquity, the thinkers
of to-day strove to be in agreement with those alike of
the Middle Ages and of antiquity, and there arise from
this intercommunion of knowledge, groups of ideas of which
some are borrowed and some original, some true and some
false; these are dependent on the intellectual lucidity and
vigour of the latest arrivals in the arena. Many problems
are thus threshed out before our eyes. Not long ago three
philosophers were in dispute and Noiré records the arguments;
the discussion turned on the question of priority
of thought or speech.</p>

<p>They agreed on the fundamental point, all three said
there could be no reason without language, nor language
without reason. But as they penetrated more deeply into
the question, they perceived divergencies; although the
conception and the word be inseparable, yet there may be
a moment of time&mdash;infinitely little, doubtless&mdash;between
the arrival of the one and of the other, as with twins.</p>

<p>According to Schopenhauer conceptions were the first
in the field, and their immediate duty consisted in creating
words; since the mind could not deal with ideas at will,
could neither evoke them, grasp them, nor reject them,
whilst no signs were attached to them.</p>

<p>To this Geiger objected. How could ideas be produced<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
whilst no signs existed with which to represent them?
Words came first, and thought, rendered possible by the
development of language, followed; “language has created
reason; before language, man was without reason.”<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Max Müller replied to both. How could there be a
sign when there was nothing to represent? Conceptions
and words, inseparable from the beginning, were produced
on the same day; the day when man’s history begins;
before that what was a fugitive impression and a vocal
sound void of sense, became a conception. Max Müller
adds: “If Geiger had said that with every new word
there is more reason, or that every progress of reason
is marked by a new word, he would have been right, for
the growth of reason and language may be said to be
coral-like, each shell is the product of life, and becomes
in turn the support of new life.”<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The most important results obtained during the Middle
Ages on these subjects find their representations in this
discussion carried on by the three learned contemporaries.
Max Müller’s point of view is one which reconciles the two
diverse opinions.</p>

<p>Men still find themselves under the magic influence of
the past after some thousands of years; the first words
which our ancestors used in the midst of their ordinary
occupations have not ceased to appear in our daily conversations,
in our philosophical writings, and in the reports
of scientific proceedings; it is impossible to speak of our
family or social relations, of our affections, our ordinary
obligations, our most sacred duties, our observance of laws,
without having recourse to words and expressions, which
represent the acts of linking or <em>tying</em>, those early activities
of our ancestors. The chemist speaks of the <em>affinity</em> of
the substances with which he is working; the poet and
the devout believer when giving free scope to their highest<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
aspirations do not find truer or loftier terms than <em>links</em>,
<em>chains</em>, <em>ties</em>, for that which connects them with the Giver
of all pure, sublime thoughts.</p>

<p>As it is possible in the present day to speak of <em>delving</em>
into a question (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">creuser</i>) and of <em>racking</em> our brains (creuser)
when we puzzle over a conundrum; of <em>linking</em> one idea
to another; of <em>polishing</em> our manners by the help of art
and letters; of seeking to <em>soften</em> the heart of God by
offerings (as if He were a mercenary Judge), of linking
ourselves with others the better to accomplish a good
work, of uniting in freeing ourselves from an undesirable
opponent; it follows that our ancestors as they emerged
from their condition of muteness found it necessary to
<em>dig</em> (creuser) cabins for themselves, to <em>polish</em> stones, to
weave and plait branches together, and to soften tough
roots for their nourishment. The same words repeat
themselves from time immemorial.</p>

<p>But how comes it that these words, which have remained
the same outwardly, have so completely changed their
meaning as exactly to adapt themselves to modern usage?
We have been deceived by appearances. These words
have not changed their meaning, but at first they were
applied to tangible objects and visible acts, those which
were the most necessary and the most usual in daily life
at that time; and now these words are applied to intangible
things, and invisible acts, the most necessary and usual in
our present mental life.</p>

<p>Nor is this which follows less curious. This adaptation
of the old words to modern usages could only have been
accomplished on one condition, that we should forget many
things, and be utterly oblivious to the original destination
of these words; that we should put from before our eyes
all images of caves, branches, stones and tough roots; and
this condition we have fulfilled absolutely; the forgetfulness
has been complete; no one suspects the source of
these expressions; only a small number of men knows it,<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
but these men are thoroughly aware that they are making
use of the true primitive forms of the human language.</p>

<p>A difficulty to be avoided still remains. It might be
said that, as it is the result of concerted action undertaken
from a community of interest, that these images have
become fixed in the memory, and that if the ideas and
representations exercised so potent a spell on us, that we
were compelled to use the words which can be traced back
to the first period of language, does it not follow that we
absolutely resemble each other, and that consequently we
must renounce the idea of attributing the least individuality
to ourselves? This is a great mistake. Each one of us
gives to these representations of ideas that form towards
which he is impelled by his own nature, his education, his
environment. A man who has some knowledge of astronomy
will look at the star-lit sky with quite another eye to that
of the poet, who knows nothing of the subject but is struck
with its inexpressible splendour. A landscape painter
would see in a tree details of beauty which would quite
escape one who admired it, but had never sought to draw
it; a clever architect with one glance at a newly-built
house could assign it a place either with the failures or
with those houses which were a success, and this glance
would sufficiently account for the murmured exclamation,
“How gladly would I live in it!”</p>

</div>


<p>How is it that primitive man, provided with five senses
which bring him into contact with the material world
only, has found it possible to conceive the existence of an
invisible world peopled with beings whom his eyes cannot
see, nor his hands touch, nor his ears hear?</p>

<p>Between the birth of human reason and the invention
of writing a long period of time elapsed; when the art of
writing was followed by that of printing, man then printed
all that he had thought and written, and at present we
possess thousands of volumes which will inform us on all
the truths and errors which have alternately illuminated
and obscured the human mind.</p>

<p>Whoever would take the trouble to examine this mass
of documents, and read those which furnish an approximate
estimate of the mental activity of our primitive
ancestors, will see that the human <em>ego</em> pursued science
unconsciously long before scholars appeared, and applied
the name of philosophers to themselves, because they had
sought patiently and with many discussions, through
thousands of centuries, to find the best way of arriving at
the truth.</p>

<p>These ancestors of ours were of an enquiring turn of
mind.</p>

<p>The appearance of religion amongst men is at the same
time the most natural and the most supernatural fact in
the history of humanity.</p>

<p>The greater number of philosophers have recognised
that the tendency of the human mind to turn towards<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
that which is outside the domain of the senses is as
powerful in man as the desire of eating and drinking is in
all living beings. The ancients acknowledged this to be
a true sense, as irresistible as the rest of the operations of
our external senses, and they have well named it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sensus
numinis</i>&mdash;the consciousness of the divine. The desire of
understanding the secrets with which the Unknown was
invested naturally led to the investigation of the influence
which these secrets might exercise on the destinies of
mankind. Amongst certain peoples this gave birth to
the art of divination. To this they abandoned themselves
in all sincerity, not doubting that omnipotent beings
would always be ready to make their will known to
mortals.</p>

<p>The men of modern times have shown that they have
the critical faculty more highly developed, and their investigations
have dealt more with practical matters. In
the eighteenth century, writers, historians and philosophers&mdash;Voltaire
amongst the number&mdash;wishing to know how
the phenomenon of mental religion appeared in the world,
collected all the data to be obtained from travellers concerning
savages; they found that without exception all
believed in occult powers, as distinct from material or
human forces, and doubted not the efficacy of certain
magic arts in use amongst them to attract these powers to
themselves, and to constrain them to act on their behalf.
Judging by analogy these writers contend that primitive
man, doubtless impressed by the alarming phenomena of
nature, would make search for the unknown beings around
him, whom the storms, the thunders and the lightnings
obey, but these beings were invisible, consequently there
must be an invisible world in communication with the
visible or human world.</p>

<p>In this way were the beliefs of the present-day savages
supposed to be those current at the dawn of religious conceptions
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>The ignorance of a subject, of whatever nature, has
never prevented the laying down of axioms concerning
that subject. Towards the end of the eighteenth century
some Portuguese navigators, who never embarked without
providing themselves with talisman and amulet,&mdash;to protect
them during their voyages,&mdash;which they called <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feitiços</i>,
seeing some negroes of the Gold Coast prostrating themselves
with every appearance of reverence, before bones,
stones, or the tails of some animals, concluded at once
without further investigation that these were considered
as divinities by the negroes; and on their return to their
native land, they spread the report that savage races worshipped
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feitiços</i>. This word <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">feitiços</i> corresponds to the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factitius</i>, meaning that which is made by hand, as
the amulets were which belonged to the Portuguese sailors.
The well-known President de Brosses used the name and
promulgated the idea, and without having set foot on
countries inhabited by negroes, composed and published a
book on their fetishes. In this manner the French language
was enriched in 1760 by the new word fetish. All
this seemed so natural and plausible that the word, and
the idea of the adoration of fetishes became quite general;
the theory of the worship of fetishes penetrated rapidly,
and took deep root in the public mind, it found its way
very readily into school books and manuals, and we were
taught that the religion of savages consists solely in the
worship of fetishes, and learned writers draw the conclusion
that fetishism must necessarily have been the primitive
religion of humanity.</p>

<p>With what readiness do well-instructed persons, no less
than the ignorant, allow themselves to speak without sufficiently
reflecting on what they say. In order to elevate
material objects, of whatever kind, to the rank of divinities,
it would be necessary previously to possess the concept of
a divinity. Writers on religion speak of that as existing
in primitive times which they seek to describe; they might<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
as well say that primitive men mummified their dead
before they had <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">mûm</i> or wax to embalm them with.
Fetishism cannot be considered as absolutely primitive,
seeing that from its nature it must presuppose the previous
growth of the predicate God. This idea of De Brosses and
his successors will remain for ever a striking anachronism
in the history of religion.</p>

<p>The history of all primitive races opens with this note.
“Man is conscious of a divine descent, though made from
the dust of the earth; the Hindoo doubted it not, though
he called Dyn his father, and Prithvi his mother; Plato
knew it when he said the earth produced men, but that
God formed them.”</p>

<p>On the banks of the Rhine, Tacitus listened to the war-songs
of the Germans; they were to him in an unknown
tongue. “It resembles the whisperings of birds,” he said,
but added, “They are cries of valour,” and his ear caught
the sound of two words which recurred frequently, “Tuisto
Mannus!”</p>

<p>We now know what formed the basis of these songs;
the Germans were celebrating their lineal ancestors under
the names of Tuisto, and Mannus, his son. Tuisto appears
to have been one form of Tiu, the Aryan god of light.
Tacitus tells us that the Germans “called by the names of
gods that hidden thing which they did not perceive except
by reverence.”<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Mannus, so the Germans considered,
sprang from the earth, which they venerated as their
mother-earth who before nourishing her children on its
fruits first gave them life. This Mannus, grandson of the
god of light, meant originally man.</p>

<p>Certain races living beyond the pale of organised religious
systems having been interrogated have furnished
the following information concerning their belief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>A very low race in India is supposed to worship the
sun under the name of Chando or Cando; they declared
to the missionaries who had settled amongst them that
Chando had created the world. “How is that possible!
Who then has created the sun itself?” They replied
with “We do not mean the visible Chando, but an
invisible one.”<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>“Our god,” said the original natives of California to
those who asked in what god they believed, “our god
has neither father nor mother, and his origin is quite
unknown. But he is present everywhere, he sees everything
even at midnight, though himself invisible to
human eyes. He is the friend of all good people, and he
punishes the evil-doers.”</p>

<p>A Blackfoot Indian, when arguing with a Christian
missionary, said: “There were two religions given by the
Great Spirit, one in a book for the guidance of the white
men, who, by following its teaching, will reach the white
man’s heaven; the other is in the heads of the Indians,
in the sky, rocks, rivers and mountains. And the red
men who listen to God in nature, will hear his voice, and
find at last the heaven beyond.”</p>

<p>These Indians consider that that external nature which
to us is at the same time the veil and the revelation of
the Divine, is sufficient to teach them so much concerning
the Supreme Being that missionaries are superfluous.</p>

<p>Amongst those whose thoughts are occupied by the
origin of religious perception in man, there exist several
theories; the first, that the idea of infinity is a necessity
to the mind of man, and that by enlarging the boundaries
of space and of time, it arrives at that which is without
space and without time. Thus may a true philosopher
reason; but primitive man was no philosopher, and the
infinite of philosophy had no existence for him. Another
theory is that man is naturally endowed with religious<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
instincts, which render him&mdash;alone of all living creatures&mdash;capable
of perceiving the infinite in the invisible; but
the nature of this innate instinct not being clearly defined,
it is in vain that we try to explain one mystery by
another. Others again affirm that religious impressions
were the result of a supernatural revelation, but they
seem vague with regard to the time in the life of
humanity, to which people, and in what manner this
came to pass. At the same time they draw attention to
the fact that men have always arrived at conclusions
rapidly, and, as they consider, without due reflection; one of
these conclusions is that <em>God is</em>. Let us, for the sake of
argument, replace the word <em>man</em> by the word <em>intuitive
sense</em> or apprehension, and we shall understand why this
intuitive sense renders it a superfluous task to make great
researches as to the reasons of man’s decision that <em>God is</em>.
This intuitive sense is wise, and utters at times great
truths; but the philosophers who consider it their metier
to seek for the reason of things are not content with what
satisfies intuitive sense, and they act on their right.</p>

<p>In our days the religious problem is viewed from two
sides. What is understood by these words&mdash;the conception
of God? This is the question of questions; and the
names of the writers on the subject, both philosophical
and theological, are too numerous to give. It is a psychological
and thought impelling study.</p>

<p>How did the idea of God first arise in the minds of
primitive man? This is another question which few try
and answer. It is a historical study.</p>

<p>This presentation of the problem is perhaps not calculated
to inspire excitement or let loose agitating passions;
and apparently the end of the nineteenth century will not
witness the renewal of the philosophical debates on the
subject which characterised the last half of the eighteenth.</p>

<p>Never either, before or since, has there been so much
agitation, nor have men’s minds been so tossed by diverse<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
currents. Many various theories were promulgated at the
time, but opinions grouped themselves chiefly round two
diametrically opposite schools of thought, towards one or
the other of which they leaned.</p>

<p>According to Hume, Condillac and their adherents,
matter alone exists; our understanding, our feelings, our
will are only transformed sensations. This was pure
materialism. Pure idealism was represented by Berkeley,
who went so far as to deny the reality of matter; according
to him the bodies making up the universe have no
real existence; the true realities were God and the ideas
He produced in us.</p>

<p>Those who preserved their ancient beliefs were the
most troubled, they began to ask themselves whether the
foundations of their faith were solid, and they much
desired to see certain problems solved. These thoughts
had exercised the minds of the sages of India, the thinkers
of Greece, the dreamers of Alexandria, and the divines
and scholars of the Middle Ages. They were the old
problems of the world, what we know of the Infinite, the
questions of the beginning and end of our existence; the
questions of the possibility of absolute certainty in the
evidence of the senses, of reason or of faith.</p>

<p>How much was comprehended in these enquiries.</p>

<p>One hundred years previously, the cautious reasoner,
Descartes, instead of asking “What do we know?” posed
in its place the question, “How do we know?”</p>

<p>This was in fact a fundamental question which appealed
to philosophers who followed Descartes, as of the utmost
importance, and they also asked themselves, “After
what manner does the human mind acquire what it
knows?”</p>

<p>What is called Locke’s tenet, “Nihil est in intellectu
quod non ante fuerit in sensu,” Leibnitz answered by
“Nihil&mdash;nisi intellectus.” Noiré gives this sentiment a
fresh turn by saying: “There is nothing in this plant that<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
was not already in the soil, the water and the atmosphere,
but that which causes this plant to be a plant.”</p>

<p>Condillac, who agreed with Locke, thus formulated his
opinion: “Penser c’est sentir”; or, “In order to feel it
is necessary to possess senses,” which is self-evident.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this sentence scandalised some of the
philosophers, they considered it degraded thought. It
degraded thought only in Condillac’s mouth, since he and
his school had previously taken out of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sentir</i> or sensation
all that possessed the right to be called thought; but for
those who admit that sensation is really impregnated with
thought it is no degradation; it is then true to say that
thought is sensation, in the same way as an oak-tree may
be said to be the acorn; and a little reflection will show
us that “the acorn is far more wonderful than the oak, and
perceiving far more wonderful than thinking.” This was
not acknowledged by some who disagreed as to the nature
of reason and sensation; they considered the former a
mysterious power that could only be a direct gift of the
Creator, and the senses, to which we owe our perceptions,
appeared so natural and simple, as not to require a scientific
explanation.</p>

<p>If philosophers, such as Descartes and Leibnitz, succeeded
in influencing certain enlightened spirits, their
language was not understood by the general public; and
Berkeley’s idealism when pushed to the extreme point,
proved too abstract to counterbalance the sensualist doctrines;
its language hardly penetrated beyond the inner
circle of the experts dealing with the subject, whereas the
writings of Locke, Condillac and Hume permeated all classes
of society; everywhere the same questions were asked,
and often unanswered amidst the maze of metaphysics, in
which it would have been difficult to obtain a precise
explanation of a science not yet clearly defined.</p>

<p>It is natural that reason after its high flight in pursuit
of truth, frightened by the obstacles met in its ascent, and<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
by the contradictions found in itself, should fall heavily to
earth, exclaiming with Voltaire, “O metaphysics, we are
as advanced as in the times of the Druids.” This same
feeling of distrust towards proceedings which resulted only
in hypothesis, was also expressed by Newton, who, recognising
that philosophy moved nowhere so freely nor
with such certainty as in the domain of facts, recently
cried, “O physics, preserve me from metaphysics.”</p>

<p>“Towards the end of the eighteenth century the current
public opinion had been decidedly in favour of materialism,
but a reaction was slowly setting in in the minds of independent
thinkers when Kant appeared”; he came so
exactly in the nick of time that one almost doubts
whether the tide was turning, or whether he turned the
tide.</p>

<p>To sketch briefly the chief points in Kant’s system such
as he has given us in his book called <cite>Critique of Pure
Reason</cite>, is a rash proceeding; my object, which is to
satisfy the imperious and more immediate wants of our
moral being, could only be attained by ignoring the
irradicable difficulties; this is excusable if we, unlearned
members of society, are to form any idea of this same
philosophy.</p>

<p>The technical terms which abound in philosophical
works are useful in the exposition of a system, but rather
the reverse for those who are striving to grasp its salient
features; for understanding these terms partially only, or
not understanding them at all, they are tempted to
imagine that they take in the meaning; this leads to
vague notions being entertained on a subject which is
nevertheless earnestly studied. Generally I abstain from
the use of esoteric terms, but Kant having coined fresh
ones to express his ideas it behoves us to use his own
formula. To paraphrase them so as to render them
intelligible without multiplying them might only further
obscure the sense, and yet, on the other hand, to enter<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
freely into further developments would require a volume,
and the end would be better served by going direct to
Kant’s work. Hence the embarrassment I feel on
approaching the subject.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_149a"><span class="smcap">Kant’s Teaching.</span></h3>

<p>Kant undertook a work which no one before him
had attempted. Instead of criticising, as was then the
fashion, the result of our knowledge, whether in religion
or in history, or science, he shut his eyes resolutely to all
that philosophy, whether sensualistic or spiritualistic
asserted as true, and making Descartes his starting point
he boldly went to the root of the matter; he questioned
whether human reason had the power of perceiving the
truth, and in cases where this power existed&mdash;but with
limits&mdash;he sought to discover why these limits existed.
He therefore resolved to subject reason itself to his
searching analysis, and thus to assist, as it were, at the
birth of thought. He accomplished this extraordinary
task with an ease of which no one previously would have
been capable.</p>

<p>The world is governed by immutable laws, and the
human race is subject to them. Kant gives an account of
those which it must necessarily obey in order to pass from
a passive “mirror” into a conscious mind.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_149b"><span class="smcap">Sensation.</span></h3>

<p>In any material object I may seek to obtain, such as
a table, my interests are concentrated in the table itself,
not on the tools which the workman has used in its
manufacture; but if it were a question of thought, then
the means by which it was produced by the human mind
engage us; and these means, of course, consist in the
proper use of the instruments at man’s disposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>That which was at the origin of mankind is repeated
at the birth of every human being; he comes into the
world in a lethargic condition, but endowed with latent
instincts which we name in one word, sense; common to
man and to animals, it places them in relationship with
the things exterior to themselves; this sense, or capability
of sensation, is merely the general faculty of feeling. No
newly-born child would emerge from its torpor if it were
not surrounded by material objects which affirm their
presence by reacting on him; his first act, at the moment
when he perceives his surroundings is the transference
of his own mind, until now isolated in itself alone, towards
the objects which solicit his attention.</p>

<p>The sense which operates in each child is inward, we
name it briefly&mdash;sensation&mdash;to distinguish it from the
five external senses, which are more familiar to us, since
even at school their functions and modes of action have
been explained to us.</p>

<p>For instance, we know that it is only necessary to touch
the strings of an instrument to cause them to vibrate, the
vibrations are communicated to the air, and are then
called waves of sound; they diffuse themselves with an
incredible swiftness in space, advancing and retreating in
the manner of the waves of the sea, they reach our ears,
touch the auditory nerve, cause the tympanum to vibrate,
penetrate to the brain, and give us instantaneously the
sensation of sound. And it is to the waves of light passing
through the ether, and communicating with the optic
nerve of the organ of sight, that we owe the sensation of
sight of the objects before us.</p>

<p>The vacant look of a newly-born infant, implies that it
has undergone an experience, it has felt something of the
nature of a shock; a shock always implies resistance and
yielding. In the child it is the human eye becoming
conscious of itself amidst the impressions produced on it
by the confused sight of external objects, and hearing the<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
noises which occur around him. This instance is analogous
to the vibratory movement of the waves described and even
drawn in all manuals on physics.</p>

<p>It is strange that a natural phenomenon which learned
men have taken some trouble to analyse, should find
expression in the following commonplace phrase. “From
the clash of opinions light is generated.” If this phrase
were not only on our lips, but also implanted in our mind,
we should more readily have grasped the physiological fact
of sensation.</p>

<p>Sensation plays such an important part in the world of
humanity, that all the sciences, both physical and moral,
deal with it; but we, who grumble so readily and continuously
at feeling either too hot or too cold, probably
never enquire what philosophy has to do with purely
bodily impressions.</p>

<p>Sensations come to us from without, but they would
leave us in a condition of perturbation only, if whilst
receiving them we were passive as a mirror on which
external objects are reflected; we might have continued
to sleep&mdash;perchance to dream&mdash;if a mental act on our
part did not mark the awakening of our intelligence when
in contact with the material world, and thus have proved
the existence of a power within us hitherto latent, but
quite capable of accepting, knowing, and realising sensations
which come to us without having been summoned.</p>

<p>We are nearing the solution of the problem. Descartes
had asked: How we know. Kant had clearly explained
that all our knowledge has its commencement in our
senses, which give us pure intuitions, that is to say, a
clear direct view of external objects, and he also proved
that intelligence would not have been aroused without
the aid of material objects. But still greater discoveries
awaited Kant.</p>

<p>We feel that nothing in ourselves is so free as thought.
It comprehends the whole world, it mounts to the stars,<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
it descends to the bowels of the earth, arrested perhaps in
its path by special objects on which it dwells at will; but
although free to encircle the universe, it may not choose
its path, thought is obliged&mdash;like the sun&mdash;to follow one
which has been previously traced out for it; of this we
can readily convince ourselves.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_152a"><span class="smcap">Space and Time.</span></h3>

<p>All objects of which we become conscious must be
placed by us in the imagination side by side in space, and
at a distance from ourselves, here or there; as being now
present, or as having been, or about to be; but always in
succession, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, in time, time past, present and future.</p>

<p>According to Kant, Space and Time are two fundamental
or inevitable conditions of all sensuous manifestations,
and he was the first to observe that they are imposed
by so absolute a power that no effort, on our part, would
enable us to escape from them, any more than we could
avoid seeing the light of day at noon, unless we are either
blind or have our eyes shut.</p>

<p>We must make it clear that what we call Space and
Time, being forms of our sensuous intuition, do not exist
apart from ourselves, or, as Max Müller says, “depend
on us as recipients, as perceivers.” It is we who say there
can be no <em>Here</em> without a <em>There</em>, and no <em>Now</em> without a
<em>Then</em>; and this is necessary, since we are dependent on
the mould of our minds, which work in accordance with
their constitutions.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_152b"><span class="smcap">Phenomena.</span></h3>

<p>When opening a dictionary at the letters P. H. E. we
should soon arrive at the word Phenomenon and its
meaning: whatever is presented to the senses, or affects
us physically or morally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>As long as knowledge comes to us only by the way of
our senses, it follows that in speaking of affinity, electricity
and magnetism as natural phenomena, which are known to
us only by their effect on Space and Time, we speak in
accordance with our method of representation, and not as
they are <em>in themselves</em>, since we have not the least idea
what these natural forces are <em>in themselves</em>. We recognise
musical sounds because our ears hear them, and we
appreciate colours because our eyes see them; we take
cognisance of them as they appear to us, but we are
ignorant of both the one and the other as they are in
actuality, that is independently of our organs which
correspond to them. Thus all the objects that we know&mdash;from
the manner of our knowledge&mdash;become for us
phenomena, and the world in which we live is a world of
phenomena.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_153"><span class="smcap">The Categories of the Understanding.</span></h3>

<p>Besides these fundamental forms of sensuous intuition
Space and Time, Kant by his analysis of Pure Reason
discovered other conditions of our knowledge which could
not have come from without. He divides them into twelve
distinct classes, and in the phraseology of philosophy they
are called Categories of the Understanding. Aristotle had
previously arranged a table of Categories, but in his Logic
Aristotle concerns himself with the laws of thought in
general, the abstraction derived from the practical use
made of them; whilst Kant studies the facts first themselves,
or first principles, in their relation with certain
fixed objects.</p>

<p>The different categories have certain traits in common,
not a single one of our thoughts but will find a place in
the one or the other. Another feature which characterises
all is, that without them no experience would be possible,
they rule our understanding. This is very marked in the<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
category called Plurality. Let us try to think of anything
without thinking of it at the same time as one or many,
and we shall find it an impossibility. We cannot think of
an apple or speak of an apple without picturing more than
one; and Max Müller has demonstrated that rational
speech is impossible, if we cannot when speaking decide
whether the subject of a sentence consists of one or
many.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_154a"><span class="smcap">Cause and Effect.</span></h3>

<p>The ideas of <em>Cause</em> and <em>Effect</em> belong to those first
principles that reason draws from itself, and the category
of causality is one of the most important. We never
experience a sensation, of whatever kind, without attaching
it, involuntarily and necessarily, to some external object
which we know possesses the qualities corresponding to
our sensations. Thus the impressions of heat or cold,
sweet or bitter, blue or yellow, evoke immediately the
picture of certain objects which are hot or cold, such as
fire or ice; or which are sweet or bitter, such as sugar or
absinth; or blue, as the sky; or yellow, as the lemon;
and these external objects we consider as the causes, and
our bodily sensations as the effects.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_154b"><span class="smcap">Axioms.</span></h3>

<p>There are certain universal truths which are self-evident,
and were evolved not by experience only or argument, nor
science, as they are the natural appanage of common-sense,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i>, such axioms as the following: the whole is greater than
the part; a straight line is the shortest distance between
two points; each body occupies space; every event
occupies time; every effect has a cause. All these are
more certain than that the sun will rise to-morrow;
common-sense has always known them, and the entire<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
human race has not waited for the coming of Kant to
recognise these facts.</p>

<p>It is strange that the majority of men who know so
many things that are true by intuition, often make mistakes
when they begin to reflect. They imagine that all things
falling under their observation have the power of making
themselves known directly, as if they entered an empty
space in the imagination which was ready to receive them.
Are they ignorant of the fact that in order to think of an
external object, it is not necessary to have it in actuality&mdash;as
it exists in nature&mdash;before one’s eyes, but that it suffices
to imprint its image on the mind? This is very simple,
and no doubt common-sense itself would see a truism
which might be passed in silence. “What is there extraordinary,”
common-sense might say, “if in thinking of a
lemon, for instance, there should be at once presented to
the mind a yellow fruit, of acid flavour, and of a certain
shape&mdash;a lemon in fact?”</p>

<p>This remark is useful only in showing our natural incapacity
for experiencing a sensation, of whatever kind,
without connecting it with an external object possessing
corresponding attributes to the sensation, and which was its
cause.</p>

<p>In any case the truism is not to be ignored, since
Aristotle, great philosopher as he was, did not consider it
beneath his dignity to employ it. He said: “I think of
a stone; the stone is not in my mind, but its form is.”</p>

<p>To prove to common-sense that its remark has no
connection with the thesis recently laid down, would serve
no good purpose. A personal mental act, if it be lawful
to personate a quality, would alone convince common-sense
of its error; but when once convinced common-sense
would then have changed to something higher than
it had previously been. It will have mounted up one
stage towards reason, and in following this route under
the guidance of increasing reason, it will end by understanding<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
this truth as demonstrated by Kant: he who
cannot distinguish a real object from its representation
will never understand the working of the human mind.</p>

<p>The importance of this truth must excuse my digression.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_156"><span class="smcap">Metaphysics.</span></h3>

<p>The name of Kant will always be intimately connected
with the word metaphysics, not because he buried himself
in it, as some have supposed who only know his system
of philosophy by hearsay; but because his labours consisted
in forbidding reason to approach this science which
is constantly threatening to invade it, and to get the
upper hand by putting itself in its place.</p>

<p>Kant was the first to trace with decision the line of
demarcation between the knowledge of which our reason
is capable, and that of which it is incapable. No one has
drawn so sharp a line between the knowable and the
unknowable; this was to explain metaphysics. Alfred
Fouillée has defined them as “the critical study of problems
which the mind seeks to unravel from a necessity
of its nature, although another necessity of its nature
renders it incapable of solving them”&mdash;such is metaphysics.</p>

<p>This definition is excellent, but for those who make no
preparatory studies in philosophy it would present itself
rather in this form. If certain questions are of necessity
presented to the mind which it finds it impossible to
solve, it follows that the mind would necessarily contradict
itself. Thus this succinct definition of Fouillée requires
to be itself defined.</p>

<p>Noiré, whilst giving more details, is also more exact.
“Metaphysics is only explained on the condition that we
understand the nature of our power of understanding, in
so far as, on the one part, this power is actively manifested
in experience, and secondly, in so far as it possesses<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
anteriorly to any experience, and to anything observed,
certain ideas without which there could not possibly or
even conceivably, be any impression made in the human
mind.” I am afraid that this explanation of Noiré will
also be lost upon those who are not experienced in the
subject.</p>

<p>The explanation of Schopenhauer is not less definite,
and is more concise than the two preceding. The foundation
upon which all our knowledge and all our science
rests, is the incomprehensible&mdash;I fancy that the uninitiated
will be equally unable to understand this.</p>

<p>It is not surprising. Philosophers speak a language of
their own, which must be learnt before it can be understood,
which is the case with all languages.</p>

<p>Kant develops this thesis with greater simplicity and
clearness. “As long as the human intellect moves in the
sphere of the senses and of experience it is safe; this
sphere is very vast; it is there that all phenomena may
be known which appears in space and time, that is to say,
all belonging to the phenomenal world in which we live.
But if the intellect rebels against the gaoler which holds
it captive in the magic circle, breaks its chains and enters
into the region of ideals, it will err.”</p>

<p>Kant relates the following anecdote: “A dove, which
found great pleasure in spreading its wings, was troubled
because this pleasure was of short duration; the simple
bird was ignorant of the fact that its structure did not
admit of its taking flights such as the swallow enjoys; not
divining the real cause of its inability, it blamed the fluid
ether whose resisting power it had felt, and thought how
much better it would fly ‘in vacuo.’” The dove was mistaken.</p>

<p>Kant’s crowning merit is having discovered the object
of metaphysics not only in the categories of the understanding,
without which, as Noiré says, no impression on
the human mind would be possible, or even conceivable,<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
but chiefly in the power, inherent in our nature, of resisting
or yielding to impressions. It is this power, according
to Kant, which constitutes the transcendental side of our
knowledge.</p>

<p>The empirical school of philosophers is tried by Kant’s
recognition of the transcendental principle in man. Its
members accuse the spiritualists of seeking to raise human
nature beyond its proper level, and of wishing at the same
time to open an inlet for other truths which claim a
mysterious character and a superhuman authority. But
Kant is the very last person to encourage the thought; on
the contrary, through the whole of his philosophy he
insists that these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> forms, or antecedent conditions
of knowledge, have no authority whatever “except in and
for experience,” and to use the category of causality, for
instance, in order to establish the existence of God is,
according to Kant, a philosophical blunder.</p>

<p>“If only we could always remember the first intentions
of our words, many philosophical difficulties would vanish.”
In Greek οἰδα meant originally, I have seen, and therefore
I know. In a court of justice the witness who says, “I
saw” can hardly say anything more convincing. To apply
such a word to our knowledge of causes, forces, and faculties
would be a solecism&mdash;to apply it to God would be
self-contradictory.</p>

<p>Each of the abstract definitions of metaphysics given by
Alfred Fouillée, Noiré, and Schopenhauer contains the
leading conception of the subject; if presented in more
simple language it would be within the comprehension of
all; our understanding is blind to all with which it is
not made acquainted by intuition derived from experience.
Those things for which we have a strong desire, of which
we have a certain conviction, but which are outside the
sphere of our actual life, “for these,” as Max Müller says
in this connection, “we want another word which should
mean&mdash;I have not seen and yet I know, and that is&mdash;faith.”<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
Our senses may not always authorise us to
affirm their reality. God and the future life are not made
the subjects of phenomena.</p>

<p>All that I have said as to what distinguishes knowledge
acquired by the senses from that which is anterior to all experience
(Kant was the first to make this distinction), might
seem simple to those heedless minds which are surprised at
nothing, but complicated and confused to minds however
little attentive, and quite useless to the rest of us. There
may be something of truth in each of these primitive and
superficial estimations, but the whole truth is that all this
is very scientific, so scientific as to require a Kant to
enable those who reflect to give a lucid account of it.</p>

<p>It was by the help of this learned science that Kant
broke the serried ranks of his antagonists. Confronted
by two philosophical opinions, both of which he considered
erroneous, he proved to the materialists Condillac, Hume,
and Locke, that there is something within us which could
never have been supplied from without, which therefore
belongs to our ego, that is to say to the subject thinking
and not to the object thought of, or matter; then turning
against the Idealists of the time of Berkeley, he shows
that there is something without us which could never
have been supplied from within; and when he proved
that intellect and matter are correlative, that they exist
for each other, depend on each other, form together a
whole that should never have been torn asunder, two
streams of philosophic thought, which had been running
in separate beds, met for the first time.</p>

<p>The existence of the phenomenal world being proved
by the irrefragable testimony of the senses, is admitted
also by reason, and, as a necessary consequence, another,
not only in appearance, but which <em>will be</em>, assuredly;
as sound is independent of our hearing, as material
objects are independent of our sight; for though Kant<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
declares our inability to know objects as they are in
themselves, he does not deny their existence, since he
says, “We should be capable, if not of knowing things as
they are in themselves, at least of knowing them as they
are to us, otherwise we should arrive at the irrational
conclusion, that there may be appearances without
something that appears.”</p>

<p>Kant undertook to make an exact science of the
necessary and universal ideas of the human mind, such
as logic and mathematics, which are parts of human
knowledge; to this end he wrote <cite>Critique of Pure
Reason</cite>, afterwards he composed another work, the
<cite>Critique of Practical Reason</cite>. Practical reason may
also be called pure, in as much as it does not allow
itself to be influenced by anything but what proceeds
from itself, and reason becomes practical when it seeks an
independent principle which determines the will. This
principle is formulated by Kant in the following terms:
“Let each individual follow commands which may be
considered as a universal law imposed alike on all human
beings.”</p>

<p>This law, which man possesses in his conscience, does
not stop half way in its exactions from man since it aims
at perfection, it commands man to love his neighbour,
and to do good even to his enemy. To love and to do
acts of kindness when pleasant to oneself is natural, and
requires no command, but, otherwise, a law is required to
coerce the will, the man who submits is free, since he can
choose to infringe or to obey it; obedience to the moral
law constitutes duty, which must be accomplished because
it is our duty, and embodies the satisfaction felt in its
performance.</p>

<p>Man is under an obligation to be moral and to do his
duty, but not necessarily to be happy, yet he demands
happiness. The union of virtue and happiness being the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>, we must acknowledge the existence of<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
a power external to ourselves, endowed with intellect and
will, which makes this union possible; this power is
known to us by the name of God. The perfect good is
holiness; this life is too short to enable us to attain to it
in its perfection, it is therefore a necessity that our life
should be prolonged beyond the term of years spent on
this earth, thus we are assured of the survival of the soul
after what we term death.</p>

<p>Thus Kant speaks in his <cite>Critique of Practical
Reason</cite>.</p>

<p>I may now be permitted to speak and give my own
opinion. I hear the Positivist perhaps say: “This result
might be considered conceivable if all that has been
previously said were true; but to infer from the desire
for happiness that a supernatural power must infallibly
satisfy it might be a hallucination, or at least a
hypothesis.” If this were so we need not deride
hypotheses; in the domain of human knowledge reason
would not be itself if it never made ventures in scientific
discoveries; its path starts from the possible in making
excursions from the known to the unknown, in going from
darkness to light&mdash;hence then hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is also this fact to notice, some of the most
important of our acts are not guided by reason, it acts as
a spectator; for instance, reason is not active when we
have perception of an object, and intuitions occur in us
without the intervention of reason.</p>

<p>This was well understood by certain men who have
come forward from time to time from the multitude, the
bearers of inspired messages to the world; they have
spoken of those things which “eye hath not seen nor ear
heard,” and they were hard to be understood of the
people; but each one alike said: “I give no proof of the
truth of what I assert; do as I say, and you will know
the truth of my words.”</p>

<p>There remains little more to be said on the subject of<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
Kant. There is a serious omission in the system of this
profound thinker.</p>

<p>Nothing has so stopped the progress of Darwin’s great
conception as the injudicious efforts of his so-called
disciples to bring it to perfection. Instead of correcting
their chief, they should have weighed thoughtfully all
Kant’s arguments against the materialism of his adversaries,
and have sought to refute them; if they had
succeeded in proving that Kant makes a mistake when he
admits that there is in man a principle quite distinct from
his body, they would have been authorised in replacing
Darwin’s theory by their own; if they had not succeeded,
Darwin and his theory would have remained unshaken,
but they would be annihilated.</p>

<p>Max Müller examines the question from another point
of view. “We admit that as we know nothing, except by
analogy, of the mind of animals, we could not with the
weapons that Kant has placed in our hands, make head
against the assertion that they might possess, for all we
know, the same forms of sensuous intuition and the same
categories of the understanding which we possess. Nothing,
therefore, could have been said from a purely philosophical
point of view, against treating man as a mere variety of
some other genus of animals.”<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But as the origin of
language was to Kant less than a secondary question&mdash;it
might almost be said to have no existence for him&mdash;it
belongs to the science of language to show, what Kant had
never shown, that for all human knowledge not only were
percepts and concepts necessary, but also names. How
was it that it did not occur to Kant since he perceived
that there were mathematics of the forms or manifestations
of sensation, namely, time or duration and space?
He said well: Each object of which we think is attached
in time or space to another; this can only be done by the
use of such indications as <em>now</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>here</em>, <em>there</em>; and he<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
saw in this gradation of perception, the first step towards
the act of counting, that is to say of reasoning, and consequently
of speaking; all of which was comprehended by
the Greeks in their word Logos. As an instance the
word <em>cent</em> exists in every language, but <em>cent</em> in French
consists only of four letters placed side by side one after
the other, and would never be anything else to us if we
could not count; but to count is to add and to take away,
that is to say, addition and subtraction, thus to conceive
and name; in order to possess a hundred objects, it does
not suffice to see them only, it is necessary to count them
up to the hundred.</p>

<p>These two works of Kant’s, the <cite>Critique of Pure
Reason</cite> and the <cite>Critique of Practical Reason</cite> appear
to emanate from two different pens; in the first, whatever
is asserted is proved. The second work is dictated by a
personal experience; Kant affirms that thus it is and that
it cannot be otherwise. But here again I perceive a lack,
a want, if not from the believer’s point of view, yet from
that of those people who ask what could be the religion
of our primitive ancestors; personal experience is not expressed
as Kant expresses it, unless it is the result of a
long series of meditations and examinations of conscience;
in a word, experiences which have been transmitted from
generation to generation. This is a religion that has
achieved much, it is not that form of it which would be
found amongst the generality of men, and still less would
it spring to life in the heart of primitive man.</p>

<p>But here are two positivist philosophers who undertake
to solve this great problem: they consider reason as ready
with a reply to those who seek to know the meaning of
God and of religion, two concepts which are inseparable,
the one from the other; and even ready to explain how
these two concepts have penetrated into the consciousness
of all human beings. These philosophers speak no doubt
from experience, for having questioned their reason it<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
has replied to them: God and religion form one
conception.</p>

<p>The first explanation is&mdash;man is conscious of his
condition; he is possessed with the desire of happiness,
and is unable to realise it; but his imagination represents
to him another state in which the desire of happiness will
exist and in which there will be no obstacle to its realisation;
the first of these states is real, the other visible to
the mind’s eye; they are therefore not identical; to will
and not to have the power is to be man; to will and to
be omnipotent is to be God. Little by little man understands
that these two states of conditions having been
conceived by the same mind, have the same origin; the
notion fixes itself firmly in his mind that the two states
seem gradually to approach each other, and are not always
distinguishable; the union of desire and power is the
Divine essence; the growing consciousness of this union
is religion, which dawns and increases in man.</p>

<p>Man does not desire immortality because he believes in
it, nor because it is demonstrable; but he believes in it
and demonstrates its existence because he desires it. The
sentence, “God sees all,” does not mean, so we are told,
what it appears to mean; it expresses the feeling God
knows all of which man is ignorant, but which he fain
would know; and the sentence, “God is beneficence,” is
the cry of man who desires happiness. All the predicates
applied by man to the Deity in the course of history
and humanity have never, in the opinion of philosophers,
had any other origin than the representation of our
wishes.</p>

<p>But the inner combat, which has been long and unhappy,
with no truce, has exhausted man’s powers, and
when the despondency checks, and at times almost
paralyses his flight after happiness, the instinct of self-preservation
leads him towards religion; as this instinct
with the incapacity of satisfying it is inseparable in<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
man, motives of religion are renewed continually in
each individual and consequently in the multitude.</p>

<p>God and religion, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> the outward sign of our union
with God, yet emanates from ourselves. This system, of
which Feuerbach is the exponent, has many followers
amongst the Positivists.</p>

<p>The second explanation comes from a learned member
of the extreme Positivist school in Germany; but, as
Max Müller says, it would be impossible to represent
religion in a worse light ... “and it would be difficult
to take a lower view of it.”<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> According to Dr Gruppe,
religion exists simply because it satisfies certain selfish
instincts of man. He notices two. The first instinct is
common to all organic beings; it tends towards the
preservation of the individual, and consequently to that
of the race; it is elementary, and acts from within outwards.
The second instinct belongs only to man taken
collectively, and has vitality only in numbers; it belongs
to a more advanced stage, and acts from without inwardly.
Man instinctively grasps the greatest amount of happiness
possible; he therefore seeks that which he considers his
greatest good, not after the fashion of the beasts, but in
his own way.</p>

<p>“We call religious belief,” says Dr Gruppe, “a belief in
an indefinable state or being which we strive to bring into
our sphere, and to render permanent by means of sacrificial
ceremonies, prayers, penances, and self-denial.”<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>This indefinable something, the professor considers,
would never have appeared in the world without an
impulsion, however light; an accidental movement, a
casual combination of a disordered brain, and a personality
endowed with a certain amount of energy, would have
sufficed to make a single individual the author of an idea
totally opposed to man’s good possession common sense,
and the originator of a movement which must find in the<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
surroundings in which it came to life, all facilities for its
indefinite perpetuation. It is of no consequence whether
this mental phenomenon has been produced in one individual
or in more; figures are of little account in the
matter. If this disease called hallucination<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> had remained
confined in the circumscribed sphere of one individual or
a few, a personal intelligent effort might have overcome it,
but being contagious and spreading amongst the people it
became impossible to conquer it. The natural laws of
reason once violated, the perturbed mind created a succession
of sophistical arguments which appeared to satisfy
the ineradicable desire for happiness in man; and an
incredibly tenacious opposition on the side of error assumed
menacing proportions. If the belief that the sun, instead
of disappearing each night below the horizon, would
continue to shine during the night could in any way
contribute to the happiness of mankind, men would slowly
but surely have accepted it.</p>

<p>The man who isolates himself from his fellow men and
becomes self-absorbed is peculiarly apt to create for
himself mental pictures which give him pleasure; if,
then, joy is indispensable to man’s existence, the religion
which gives it, or the illusion of it, enables him to forget
the tangible world, and substitute an imaginary one
peopled with phantoms. But the solitary man is a rare
phenomenon, and we judge favourably those men who live
in the midst of their social surroundings, and whose
community of ideas and sentiments has made a homogeneous
whole, during many centuries. Each one will
find means to develop his personal faculties, and to
strengthen his power of resistance in the struggle of all
against all, and the good which is illusive in the solitary
man becomes a benefit to the members of the society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>Religion might possibly cease to exist, in Gruppe’s
opinion, were it not for the inequalities of man’s condition,
and for the troubles which follow him; but the
action of religion is helpful to society.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It tells the poor
not to hanker after riches which are not lasting. It
mirrors for them images of future compensations, thus the
rich and the noble here are enabled to enjoy their pleasures
on earth in safety. In its name bright hopes are built up
for the wretched, and it takes its stand in front of the
palaces of the rich; sedatives are prescribed for incurables,
and rich foods for those who can pay for them.
Charity is preached to the compassionate, and persecutions
to the fanatics: at times it encourages the use of arts and
sciences; at times it warns its followers not to love overmuch
the beautiful in art, nor to seek too earnestly the
truth in science. But the outcome of this religion,
whether good or the reverse, is of small importance
compared with the benefits it renders to society. It is
the support of the civil and moral law, and in lighting
the hymeneal torch it adds to the sanctity of families.</p>

<p>Without attributing selfish motives, in the lowest sense,
to the founders of the various religions and sects which
flourish in our midst, Gruppe considers all of them unconscious
egoists; he thinks that had they been calm psychologists,
which sincere prophets are not, they would have
recognised in themselves the attraction that glory had for
them; but in that case they would not have remained
faithful unto the death, and the power of communicating
their own spirit and force to their adherents would have
failed them. Gruppe distinguishes with great keenness
the reflex action of our desire for happiness, which is no
other than the instinct of self-preservation, from the
motives which are sufficient to inspire certain enthusiasts<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
to found new religions; these two things are in reality
quite distinct, although they may act in concert; the
desire for universal and permanent happiness paves the
way for the manifestation of individual enthusiasm; he
asserts that religions, while professing to found a new
kingdom of heaven, only succeed in inheriting the kingdom
of this world.</p>

<p>The struggle between an extreme positivism and a true
idealism is a sight that energises earnest men. Evidently
impressed by the exposition of the spiritualist doctrine, the
learned doctor remarks: “The first perception of the
infinite, of law and order in nature, communicated an
impulse to the mind of man; but this force, when once in
movement, did not slacken before having called forth in
our ancestors the conviction that all is right and good, and
the hope&mdash;even more than hope&mdash;that all would be right
and good. Such is the celebrated system of Max Müller.
It is not only the great personal worth of the author that
obliges us to give it close consideration, but also the fact
that this system is the most eloquent exposition of an idea
which has also been expressed by other writers in some
remarkable works on the history of religions. The
position in which Max Müller has placed himself for a
starting-point is, from a positivist point of view, impregnable.”</p>

<p>This commendation, which is particularly striking,
coming as it does from one of Max Müller’s fiercest
adversaries, I have quoted word for word.</p>

<p>Gruppe is not only a positivist philosopher, but also
learned in Eastern languages and literature, and a clever
mythologist; it would have been better had he confined
himself to fields of labour with which he was acquainted.
But as he admits that there is psychological and spontaneous
thought in man, side by side with the rational, he
cannot but acknowledge the right of humanity to say what
it thinks. There are certain literary documents which<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
show us what the human mind has thought in all ages and
in all places, and we are of opinion that these sentiments
have not varied.</p>

<p>It is said that an universal belief in any fact is not a
proof of the existence of this fact, and that consequently
the conception of super-sensible things need have no real
basis; the observation is just; I shall reply to it by
a question. Is it possible to demonstrate that this belief
in things that cannot be proved is not only universal but
even inevitable? If it were possible much would be
gained. In geometrical calculations it is sufficient to
know that three dimensions only exist,&mdash;at least in this
world&mdash;that the straight line is the shortest, that two
parallel lines never meet; it should suffice to know that
in this world belief, whether rational or illusory, in one or
more divinities, is inevitable for men constituted as we
are.</p>

<p>Our first fathers no doubt pictured a large space
situated on the further side of all that they could see, and
we know how their imagination peopled it with confused
images, either hidden, or seen in the visible phenomena.</p>

<p>These flights of fancy, which may have lasted thousands
of centuries, became crystallised at last in the mythologies
of all peoples, and it is these mythologies by which we gain
access to this initial stage in the life of humanity, and
which preserves for us the traces of this eternal truth
amidst many extravagances of the fancy misled by
language, which guided their first steps. There is a
petrified philosophy in mythology.</p>

<p>Since history and legend, in one form or another, have
voiced the feelings called religion, these feelings, variously
interpreted, have changed their aspect from age to age,
and from country to country; as long as we have not
traced the stream to its source, the question, as to the
manner in which the conception of God had birth in the
human mind, will always be before us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>We take man at the time when he had recently
appeared on the earth, his sole possession being his five
senses, which place him in contact with the external world.
We must distinguish between two classes of senses;
those of touch, scent, and taste being more evident; from
the evolutionist’s point of view the sense of touch has the
largest share in the building up of the human edifice which
arose later; its use is chiefly connected with the hands,
and has thus given us the word <em>manifest</em>; that which we
call certainty hardly exists for us apart from what is manifest.
The two other senses, sight and hearing, are less
sure, and have frequently to be verified by those first
named.</p>

<p>The objects of which we obtain knowledge by means of
our senses can be divided into tangible, semi-tangible and
intangible. The first are, for instance, a stone, a bone, a
fruit, the skin of an animal, these can be touched as it
were all round, and we are able to assert their reality.
The second, the semi-tangible, might be a river, a mountain,
the earth, a tree. We stand by the banks of a
river and dip our hand in the small volume of water
passing away before our eyes; we can also touch the
ground on which we are standing, also the trunk of the
tree beneath which we are sitting; but it is only an
insignificant part of which we assert the reality by touching
it, all the other parts remain unknown to us; for the
river itself consists of a large mass of waters springing
from a source which is not seen and flowing towards a
spot which we may never see; we are told that the earth
is in the shape of a globe, and that this globe is suspended
in air, which fact it would be difficult to verify; the tree
is small in comparison with the river and the earth, and
yet how little we know of it, whence come its buds, and its
leaves, and the sap which rises each spring in the
branches? We say of a beam that it is dead wood, but
of the tree we say that it grows and lives; what is this<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
life of the tree? We are in the presence of the unknown.
These are samples of semi-tangible objects. The sense of
touch has no place with regard to the sky, the stars, the
clouds, the winds; those are intangible objects, which
we see and feel without knowing them by personal
grasp; the proof of their existence is also in the fact
that years of work are required to know astronomy and
meteorology.</p>

<p>We now have primitive man provided with fine senses,
in presence of these natural phenomena, and the problem
to be solved is this: How is it that this man is able to
think and to speak of things which are not finite, finite
things being the only ones of which his senses make him
cognisant?</p>

<p>“I have before me,” says Max Müller, “a school of
philosophy adverse to my views; I am warned that
nothing I say will be accepted, unless I submit to the
conditions imposed on me. I am told: ‘You pretend to
prove that man can know that God exists; whereas we
affirm that the great triumph of our age is that we have
proved that religion is an illusion. All knowledge must
pass through two gates, the gate of the senses and the
gate of reason, consequently religious knowledge even can
enter by no other gate.’ In this way does positivism bar
the entrance which Kant left open, who in his definition
of religion considered morality the basis of it, which with
him presupposed the existence of God. Positivism refuses
to hear a psychological and historical explanation of one
of the greatest psychological and religious facts&mdash;namely,
religion; it stops its ears when we say <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil est in fide
quod non ante fuerit in sensu</i>; but we are not discouraged
by the absurdity of imagining that by shutting
our eyes, we can annihilate facts; we accept the struggle
on the common ground on which the positivist and we
have decided to fight; we also agree to use the weapons
chosen for us. Let us inspect the battlefield and measure<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
the ground. Both sides seem in accord that all consciousness
begins with sensuous perception, with what we feel,
and hear, and see; what is likewise granted is that out of
this we construct what may be called conceptual knowledge,
consisting of collective and abstract concepts. The
conditions of the combat are fixed; at the two gates of
the senses and reason we take our stand; whatever claims
to have entered in by any other gate, whether that gate
be called primeval revelation, or religious instinct,<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> must
be rejected as contraband of thought; and whatever claims
to have entered in by the gate of reason without having
first passed through the gate of the senses, will equally
be rejected, as without sufficient warrant.”<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE VEDIC HYMNS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It has been possible to ascertain that the first words pronounced
by the most ancient members of the Aryan family
are connected by a thread of continuity to those which we
use to-day in all languages, whether living or dead; our
family would not be a portion of the entire human race,
if this continuity of thought did not form a constituent
part of the mental equipment of all the other families;
but as no others possess in an equal degree with ourselves
the archives sufficiently extensive to contain indication of
the gradual development of human speech, such as the
Veda furnishes, that is the authority to which Max Müller
appeals in all his works. And it is precisely because
there has been no cessation in the continuity of human
thought, that the historical method is the only one
capable of linking us with the primitive Aryans; our work
will consist in collecting tokens of the long pilgrimage
undertaken by our ancestors, and with which we desire to
be associated, and which those who come after us must also
undertake.</p>

<p>“No doubt, between the first daybreak of human
thought and the first hymns of praise of the Rig-Veda,
composed in the most perfect metre and the most polished
language, there may be, nay, there must be a gap that can
only be measured by generations, by hundreds, aye, by
thousands of years.”<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The exodus and separation of the
Aryan family, belonging as it does to a prehistoric epoch
and therefore unchronicled, and the Vedic Hymns&mdash;the<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
work of many centuries&mdash;having been completed and collected
together some hundreds of years before our present
era, thus at a time relatively recent, that which constitutes
their chief claim to great antiquity in our eyes is that the
Hindoo poets or rishis incorporated certain thoughts and
words in them whose roots threw out shoots in the primitive
Aryan soil before the dispersion of its members.</p>

<p>The period of the life of humanity into which the
hymns enable us to penetrate, is the most ancient of
which mention is made. The rishis sing in Sanscrit of
thoughts conceived in the hidden recesses of souls before
they awoke to the consciousness of that concept to which
the name of God alone can be applied, before these same
people pictured in their imagination those whom they
named gods, before the appearance of myths and mythological
fables, and before the Sanscrit language existed.</p>

<p>Our Aryan ancestors had not left the cradle of their race
when their language, whatever it may have been, possessed
the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i>, two cognate words meaning to shine.
The Veda shows that many things were bright to the
Vedic poets, the heaven, dawn, the stars and several other
things, such as the rivers, spring, the fields, the eyes of
man, all that would have the effect on us of being smiling,
flourishing, and rejoicing in life; and from this root the
word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i> was formed. Neither in Greek nor in Latin,
nor in any living language can a word be found which
exactly expresses <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i>; Greek dictionaries translate it by
Theos, in the same way as we translate Theos by God; but
if&mdash;dictionary in hand&mdash;we put the word God in certain
passages in the hymns where this word is found, we should
sometimes commit a mental anachronism of a thousand
years. At the time of the first Aryans, gods, in one sense
of the word, did not exist; they were slowly struggling
into being; it was therefore impossible for man to form
any conception of them even in dreams. As this word
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i> changes its signification so frequently, not only in<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
the most ancient Brahmanic poems, but also in works of
a later date, we can only obtain even an approximate idea
of its meaning by writing its history, beginning from its
etymology and ending with its latest definition; but it is
not necessary to undertake this philological labour, and I
shall content myself by showing that originally <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i> denoted
a quality common to many natural phenomena, that
of light, and therefore <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i> was a general term.</p>

<p>Man at first received this impression passively, as
animals would, but by his nature he could not rest there;
all the phenomena surrounding him were animated, the
most marvellous and those of peculiar intensity moved in
the upper regions of the firmament; in the midst of these
general movements the mind of man could not alone be
inactive, and thought and speech&mdash;that is reason&mdash;inevitably
vindicated their right to activity; names were given
to all things. The Aryan root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">svar</i> or <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">sval</i>, which signified
to shine, to sparkle, and to heat, produced a Sanscrit
substantive meaning sometimes sun and sometimes the sky.</p>

<p>The Hindoo poets, the authors of these hymns, gave
various names to the sun, according to the task it accomplished;
and each name reproduced the salient feature of
the task. The sun when rising was Mitra = friend; as it
advances on its journey, giving new life, it is Savitar =
bringing forth, or leading day; the vivifying sun; when
it collects the clouds and sends rain on the earth, it is
Indra, from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ind-u</i> = drops; and it continues to be Indra
when its rays attain their zenith and reach their greatest
splendour; for no plant flourishes without the combined
action of light and humidity; the sun is Vishnu when it
makes “its three strides” in the vault of heaven, its position
in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; it is
Varuna&mdash;the all embracing&mdash;when it envelops itself in
clouds as in a shroud, and the sky darkens. Some phenomena
descended on man from above, such as thunder-bolts,
winds, storms; the storms that came unexpectedly, dealing<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
destruction as they passed received the name of Maruts&mdash;from
the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Mar</i>&mdash;and with the meaning of those who
strike or beat to death; the thunder was called Rudra =
he who roars; the wind was Vayu = he who blows.</p>

<p>All these names indicated that which could be seen and
that which could be heard; the invisible things remained
unnamed; how was it possible for man to name that of
which he was ignorant (except that they had a real
existence), he who could only conceive a name after having
seen a certain feature or quality in the object? They made
use therefore of the names they already knew, and they
rang the changes on the storm, the fire, and the firmament,
which names they borrowed. Jacob’s prayer, which arose
in the darkness when he was wrestling with a great Unknown,
“Tell me, I pray thee, thy name,” must have been,
in the early ages, the question of all humanity; but
uttered under a thousand varying forms, and as, at the
beginning, each name was imperfect, since it expressed
only one side of the object, every additional name denoted
a step forward, and every fresh check experienced by the
mind in its search after accurate names only stimulated it
to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first germ of the concept of law and order appears
in the minds of the poets, and to this they give the name
of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Rita</i>. This word has no equivalent in our languages,
and translators are uncertain as to the meaning attached
to it by the rishis. Pliant and full of capability, there
seems no word more fitted to reflect new shades of thought;
and in our efforts to understand it conjecture is much
called into play, from the fact that we have to transfuse
ancient thought into modern forms; in that process some
violence is inevitable. Max Müller supposes, from etymological
reasons, that Rita originally was used to express
the regular movement of the heavenly bodies, and the
path which they followed daily, from the one point of
the heavens to the other, and he translates <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Rita</i> by the<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
“right path.” “If we remember how many of the ancient
sacrifices in India depended on the course of the sun, how
there were daily sacrifices, at the rising of the sun, at noon,
and at the setting of the sun; how there were offerings
for the full moon and the new moon, we may well understand
how the sacrifice itself came in time to be called the
path of Rita.”<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Rita expresses all that is right, good, and
true, and Anrita was used for whatever is false, evil, and
untrue; thus the Hindoos laid it down as an axiom that
there was an universal law in the world equally binding
on the physical phenomena and on conscious beings, such
as themselves; and it was this law which ruled the times
of the sacrifices to be offered to the divine powers; and
this intuitive perception of law and order, which is the
foundation of the ancient faith of the Asiatic Aryans, is
far more important than all the histories of Savitar, Mitra,
Rudra, and Indra, which are recounted at a later period
of the gods of India. This belief in Rita, in law and
order, as revealed in the unvarying movement of the stars,
or manifested in the unvarying number of the petals, and
stamens, and pistils of the smallest plant, was a grand
thing; it was all the difference between a chaos and a
cosmos, between the blind play of chance and a well
defined plan. We have become so familiarised with the
idea of a fundamental law, that it now often occupies us
less than many of the secondary laws or causes; and yet
our philosophers often find themselves at fault when they
endeavour to give an exact idea of this primary law; but
to the ancient prophets it must have been infinitely more
perplexing, though also infinitely more important in their
gropings after <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> on which to plant their feet.
The rishis are indefatigable in pointing to the straight
path, or Rita, followed by the day and night; and because
the gods have themselves followed this path, they have
the strength to triumph over the powers of darkness, and<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
to those who ask for it they grant the grace to walk in
the same road.</p>

<p>“O Indra, lead us on the path of Rita, on the right
path over all evils.”<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>To walk with regularity in the path of duty, imitating
the example of the astral bodies, or following step by step
the sun which never deviates from its orbit, cannot be an
idea foreign to humanity since it is equally familiar to the
primitive races and the most elevated minds. Cicero said
of himself that he was born not only to contemplate the
order of the heavenly bodies, but to imitate this order in
his own conduct; this great orator, although he was
ignorant of the existence of the Vedic hymns, spoke
after the same manner as the rishis; and the Maoris
are inspired neither by Cicero nor the Hindoo poets, when
they send forth their energetic cry, “Wait, wait, O sun,
we will go with thee.”</p>

<p>To our first ancestors nothing in nature could have been
indifferent; all that they perceived must have come upon
them as a continual surprise; the Vedic hymns show that
our surmise is correct. An irresistible force led them
continually to investigate and interrogate those apparitions
which, by their strangeness and grandeur, were so striking,
and to which they gave the names of the thunderers, the
rainers, the pounders or storm gods; no voice replied to
their questions; absolute silence reigned around them;
the limits of the known confronted them. Gradually
a different perception forced itself upon them, whether
consciously or unconsciously; all limits have two sides,
the one towards ourselves, the other towards the beyond;
they were ignorant of what existed beyond, but they
believed it to be there, since the further boundaries came
in contact with it. They wished to draw near to it in
order to examine it close at hand, but in what direction
should they advance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>The sentiments which the sun and its forerunners awoke
in our ancestors must remain for ever beyond our powers
of imagination; the rising of this luminary is to us the
result of a physical law, and is not considered more
extraordinary than the birth of a child in a large
family; we know that the dawn is the reflection of
the sun’s rays in the matutinal vapours; we have
even learnt to calculate the time of its duration in
different climates; but the assurance with which we say,
“The sun will rise to-morrow, the day after to-morrow,
every day,” our ancestors never possessed, and it was this
vast unknown domain, behind the known, that from the
very first supplied the human mind with the impetus
required to cause it to seek, to discover, what there could
be beyond the visible world.</p>

<p>As nothing seems to be so far apart as the two points
of the horizon where the light of day appears and where
he sets, it is there that the rishis look for a solution of
the problem of the beyond.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>“That whence the sun rises, and that where he sets, that
I believe is the oldest, and no one goes beyond.”<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The poets gave the name Aditi to the dawn. Aditi is
derived from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">diti</i>, binding and bond, with the negative
particle <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">a</i>; thus at first <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Aditi</i> meant that which is without
bonds, not chained, not enclosed, infinite. But their
imagination soon carried the poets beyond the dawn itself,
that came and went, but there remained always behind
the dawn that heaving sea of light or fire from which she
springs; thus Aditi herself could not be grasped by the
senses. Was not this the visible infinite?</p>

<p>At this point the mind of the rishis conceived an<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
original and striking idea, at the sight of the sun following
his path and touching two opposite points of the horizon;
they said that arrived at the centre of its course at the
zenith, Indra from thence could see at the same time Diti
and Aditi&mdash;“That is what is yonder and what is here,
what is infinite and what is finite, what is mortal and
what is immortal.”<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Whilst searching increasingly for what he had not yet
found, man had mastered two ideas, those of law, and the
beyond or the infinite, though not understanding the
accurate meaning of these words; on these two points his
mind was at rest. These two possessions once acquired
could not be taken from him; in Aditi&mdash;which is limitless&mdash;could
be found a home for things which had no
bounds, and it could furnish an answer to all questions;
and Rita, the order which rules the movements of the
celestial bodies, is at the same time an incentive and a
promise. A violent convulsion of nature may have
alarmed the hearts of men, but the thought occurs to
them, “This cannot last always.”<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>“Sun and moon move in regular succession&mdash;that we
may see, Indra, and believe.”<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Without fear there could have been no hope, without
hope there could have been no faith.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_180" href="#R_Ref_180">Śraddhâ</a>, an ancient Aryan word used before the dispersion
of the various members of the family, is the
same as the Latin Credo. Where the Romans said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">credidi</i>
the Brahmans said <a href="#R_Ref_180"><i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">śraddadhau</i></a>; where the Romans said
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">creditum</i>, the Brahmans said <a href="#R_Ref_180"><i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">śraddhitam</i></a>. The germ of<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
the faculty of faith, therefore, must have existed in the
earliest strata of thought and language, since without the
first glimpses of faith in the soul, there could have been
no word for “to believe.”</p>

<p>As auxiliary verbs were lacking at first, the early
Aryans found it very difficult to say of a thing that it is
or is not; but they possessed the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">as</i>, which originally
meant <em>to breathe</em>, and its simplest derivation was <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">as-u</i>&mdash;breath.
Man having discovered in all the natural phenomena
an activity resembling his own, said of the moon
that it measures, of the river that it runs, of the sun that
it rises and sets; thus each of these had certain activities
peculiar to itself. Was there nothing common to all?
Doubtless, since an action can be found which is shared
equally by man and all animals, the act of breathing is
common to all, so that our fathers when wishing to affirm
that something existed said that it breathed.</p>

<p>Man turns his gaze from the things that surround him
to himself; he feels superior to the physical phenomena,
to the rivers, to the mountains. He possesses another
nature to that of the sun, of the stars. He has discovered
something in himself that is more than his body. What
is it? how is he to name it? He saw his father or his
mother, who had formerly been in every respect like himself,
prostrate, without motion, without speech. What had
happened? What was it that had left them? Knowing
the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">as</i>, and its derivative <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">as-u</i>, he called it from the
first breath, then spirit, which originally meant nothing
more than the air absorbed by the lungs, from which it is
exhaled as breath. Nothing constrained our ancestors to
believe that because they had seen their parents die and
their bodies decay, it must follow that what had hitherto
animated them was now annihilated. This notion may
have entered the brain of a philosopher, but man in his
primitive simplicity, though doubtless terrified at the
sight of death, would naturally incline to the belief that<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
what he had known and loved, and had called by the
names of father and mother, must still exist somewhere,
although not in the body. The breath had not been seen
to decay. What had become of it? Various answers
were given to this question, at divers times and in divers
countries. They were all equally probable; no objections
could be made to them, but neither was there proof; they
are beyond the reach of proof. “The best answer was
perhaps that contained in the most ancient Greek language
and mythology, that the souls had gone to the
house of the Invisible, of <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Aides</i>. No one has ever said
anything truer.”</p>

<p>From the depths of the eastern sky Aditi arises each
morning. To the eyes of the ancient seers the dawn
seemed to open the gates of another world into which they
begged to enter&mdash;into the abode of the gods. We can
understand that as the sun and all the solar deities rise
from the east, Aditi was said to be the mother of Mitra,
Vishnu, Savitar, and Varuna. Another conception also
arose, that the east being the abode of the bright gods,
would also become the home of those parents and friends
who died, “the blessed departed who would join the company
of the gods that they might be transferred to the
east.”<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Aditi thus embodied the mystery of life and death;
and was the “Mot de l’Énigme” of our existence. All the
theogony and primitive philosophy of the Aryan were
concentrated in the dawn. Those souls who participate
with Aditi in the “birthplace of the Immortals” sometimes
share the worship offered by their children who are
still on the earth. One off-shoot of this ancient worship
still survives, and the popularity of the festival of the 1st
of November in certain countries testifies that the homage
rendered to the memory of the dead is a necessity of the
human heart. And certainly those whom we are accustomed
to speak of as dead are most surely living. The<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
rishis desired to contemplate their faces, and one of them,
speaking for all, cried: “Who will give us back to the
great Aditi, that I may see father and mother?”<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>All peoples have desired to know which part of the
human body is the seat of the soul and of life; the
dictionaries of all languages, whether spoken by civilised
or uncivilised people, show that the words blood, heart,
chest, reins and breath have all been used to indicate the
seat of life, soul, thought, and the affections. Amongst
the Maoris, the words used for the internal organs mean
at the same time the heart, and the centre of joy and
sorrow; the seat of conscience and of desires and the will;
it is strange that the brain, which we often look upon as
the cradle of thought, is not found in the psychological
nomenclature of the ancient world. The expression which
we find in the Bible, “The blood is the life,” and in other
languages besides Hebrew, inspired many religious and
superstitious acts. It is singular that in one of the
dialects spoken in the south of India, Tamil, the word
used for soul has the sense of leaper or dancer; these are
efforts to express that which moves within us. We are here
not amongst learned metaphysicians, but concerned with
simple children of nature; but the greatest philosophers
have at no time more clearly defined the soul than by
describing it as that which moves of itself, but is not
moved.</p>

<p>Our language is so rich in abstract terms, derived from
a small number of concrete words, that we are not aware
how often we use the old material words to express purely
mental states or conditions; for instance we speak of
taking things to heart, or learning verses by heart, without
thinking of the heart that beats within our breasts.</p>

<p>Fire has always occupied a prominent position in the
imagination of all people, of all nations; but with the
exception of the Hindoos none have left traditions which<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
enable us to transport ourselves to the simplest beginnings
of the fire upon the hearth, and nothing more. Heracleitus
already mentions fire as everlasting or immortal, and the
“origin of all things, a higher conception than that of the
gods of the populace whom Heracleitus tolerated, though he
did not believe in them. ‘Neither one of the gods,’ he
declares, ‘nor of men has made this world, ... it always
was and will be, ever-living fire, catching forms and consuming
them.’”<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Heracleitus imagined that he knew what
was fire; but the rishis speak with less assurance; at
first they express their astonishment at the appearance of
fire, it is one of the physical apparitions which impressed
them the most, although of all the devas fire seemed the
one most readily known, since it had its dwelling with
men, it was within reach of the hand, could be touched,
but as it burnt the fingers the experiment was only made
once. Although seen so near at hand fire remained a
great enigma; our ancestors could not understand how it
could unite in itself at the same time such good and such
destructive qualities. It warmed the members numbed by
cold, at night it lighted the hut as if the sun were in it,
yet at times it destroyed suddenly whole forests; it seemed
everywhere; when the thunder rolled, fire escaped from a
dark cloud like a flash; it appeared as a spark when two
flints were struck or two branches of wood rubbed together;
but its chief characteristic was its excessive mobility,
nothing in nature could compare with the velocity of its
movements.</p>

<p>The Aryans at that time possessed a root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ag</i>, which
meant going, marching, leading, running, forcing, pushing,
chasing, and jumping, and gives generally an idea of quick
movement, and as fire moved perpetually, our ancestors
made use of this root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ag</i>, and called fire <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">agni</i>; this
Sanscrit word&mdash;which amongst many others was the most
popular&mdash;still survives in the Latin, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis</i>, in Lithuania<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
as <i lang="lt" xml:lang="lt">ugni</i>, in old Slavonic, as <i lang="cu" xml:lang="cu">ogni</i>; another Sanscrit name
for fire is <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vah-ni</i>, coming from the same root which we
have in <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">veho</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">vehemens</i>, and it meant originally what
moves about quickly.</p>

<p>I have collected a few of the characteristic traits
attributed by the rishis to the deva Agni.</p>

<p>“How did he come&mdash;living&mdash;from pieces of dead wood?
How is he produced from two stones? His mother does
not nourish him, how does he grow so rapidly, and proceed
at once to do his work? He whom nothing resists&mdash;like
the heavenly thunderbolt&mdash;like a hurled weapon. Agni,
in a moment, does violence to the trees of the forest; he
prostrates them&mdash;all that moves&mdash;that which stands,
trembles before him&mdash;making the herbs his food&mdash;he licks
the garment of the earth&mdash;he nourishes himself. Turning
about with his tongues of fire, Agni flares up in the
forests. Roused by the wind, he moves about among the
tall trees, and eats them with his sharpened teeth; he
never tires; coming again and again; turning about on all
sides; resounding with his sickle; laughing with his light.”</p>

<p>“Professor Tyndal asks quite rightly: ‘Is it in the
human mind to imagine motion, without at the same time
imagining something moved? Certainly not. The very
conception of motion includes that of a moving body.
What then is the thing moved in the case of sunlight?
The undulatory theory replies that it is a substance of
determinate mechanical properties, a body which may or
may not be a form of ordinary matter, but to which,
whether it is or not, we give the name of Ether.’ May
not the ancient Aryas say with the same right (had he
been wise enough to put the question), ‘Is it in the
human mind to imagine motion without at the same time
imagining some one that moves?’ Certainly not. The
very conception of motion includes that of a mover, and,
in the end, of a prime mover.”<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And if, in the presence<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
of fire, the early Aryas had asked who then is the mover,
he would have been told (if any had been there wise
enough to answer the question) that it is a subject of
determinate properties, a person who may or may not be
like ordinary persons, but to whom, whether he be or not,
the name Agni has been given.</p>

<p>Thus the rishis spoke of Agni as of an agent, as well
as of Indra, Vayu, Rudra, and the Maruts; but we must
always remember that they knew nothing definite of these
agents any more than we do when we speak of physical
phenomena as elements, or forces of nature, or certain
movements.</p>

<p>This striking deva, Agni, manifested at first in the
lightning and in the spark, became as time went on,
the most popular, and most desired of all the powers;
the fire on the hearth rendered winter bearable, cooked
herbs and roots, and transformed the devourer of raw
flesh into the eater of roast meat; caused the smoke of
sacrifices offered to the higher Powers to ascend up to
heaven. What precautions were necessary to prevent the
capricious and uncertain fire from becoming extinct at an
inopportune moment, or in its rage from destroying men
and things. Fire was for the rishis a being more and
more inexplicable. Becoming increasingly impressed by
his beneficence, they seek to call him by some new name
which shall express more perfectly this later impression;
the name deva&mdash;bright, shining&mdash;no longer satisfies them;
they use words such as invincible, almighty; even these
do not suffice them; at last they find the word Amartya&mdash;immortal.</p>

<p class="center">“Immortal amongst Mortals.”
</p>

<p>This expression may be understood in more ways than
one; it is enough for me that the Hindoos made use of
it. It is possible to recognise in it the first attempt to
bridge over the gulf which human language and human
thought had themselves created between the visible and<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
the invisible, between the mortal and the immortal,
between the finite and the infinite. For the right
appreciation of our intellectual organisation, it is important
to discover and distinguish the coarse threads that
form the woof of our most abstract thoughts.</p>

<p>It must be noticed that the use of the word <em>immortal</em>
in this passage does not imply that Agni is considered
otherwise than as natural fire. The Rig-Veda does not
seem to acknowledge the presence of supernatural beings;
all the names given to the striking aspects of nature, even
those used to designate the unknown powers in general,
such as Asura&mdash;a living thing; Deva-asura&mdash;the living
gods; Amartya&mdash;the immortal, still retain physical elements
in the most ancient hymns.</p>

<p>Beings without definite attributes did not occur to the
imagination of those who supplied these names, and believed
in the existence of those which these names represented.</p>

<p>That which has often been called the adoration of fire
was at first its application to the necessities of domestic
life, and afterwards its use in all mechanical and artistic
pursuits. If we transfer ourselves to that early stage of
life, and picture the difficulties there were in primitive
times of procuring fire at a moment’s notice, and the
dangers which would menace a whole community deprived
of fire in the midst of winter, and plunged suddenly in
darkness, we require no far-fetched explanation for a
number of time-hallowed customs throughout the world
connected with the lighting, and still more with the
guarding of the fire. The natural desire for possessing so
useful an object, and the no less natural terror of being
deprived of it, would lead men to adopt the practices for
maintaining it, afterwards called superstitions, but which
during the infancy of humanity, were perfectly natural,
and which developed into a sacred rite; at a later period
vestal virgins were appointed to guard it in the temples;
and the fires of St John, which are still lighted annually<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
on the tops of certain mountains, are the last remains of
these ancient customs.</p>

<p>The Vedic hymns give us the many different channels
whence the phenomenon of fire proceeds, at one time
coming in one way and then in another, to attract man’s
attention and to awaken his drowsy faculties. Fire comes
from the skies where it shines as the sun, from the waters,
since it comes as lightning, from the moist and rain-laden
clouds, from the stones, and from wood, in the shape of
sparks, from dried leaves and herbs placed on the altar to
receive and nourish the sacrificial flame. Ceaselessly fire
applied at the door of each habitation. Apparently it said
to man, whose slowness of comprehension it seemed to
understand, “To you men, I come, that I may awake you
from sleep, and cause you to know what I am.”</p>

<p>At last man understood, and the rishis reply to the
fire.</p>

<p>“Thou, O Agni, art born from the skies&mdash;thou from
the waters&mdash;thou from the stone&mdash;thou from the wood&mdash;thou
from the herbs&mdash;thou, king of men, the bright one.”<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the mind of the poet seems illuminated
with a new thought.</p>

<p>“If we have committed any sin against thee through
human weakness, through thoughtlessness, make us sinless
before Aditi, O Agni, loosen our misdeeds from us on
every side.”<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Of Agni, the fire, there would seem to be nothing left
in that supreme god whose laws must be obeyed, and who
can forgive those who have broken his laws. Between
this transformed Being of whom the Aryans implore mercy,
and Him whom we call God, we can perceive no difference,
and yet, so mysterious are human speech and thought, the
Hindoos, who thought in ancient Sanscrit, declare that
Agni has not yet thrown off his physical characteristics,
that he is not yet, and cannot be God; they add that<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
it is impossible to give the true Vedic impression in its
fulness, since no modern language possesses phrases in
which to express it.</p>

<p>I read in another hymn addressed to Agni a curious
verse.</p>

<p>“O Heaven and Earth, I proclaim this truthful fact,
that the child, as soon as born, eats his parents. I, a
mortal, do not understand this fact of a god; Agni indeed
understands, for he is wise.”<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Are the rishis who utter this exclamation ignorant of
the fact that the parents of fire are two dry sticks? Or
is it that the act of a god in eating its father and mother
is abhorrent to them?</p>

<p>“If we, O gods&mdash;ignorant among the wise&mdash;transgress
your commandments, whatever of the sacrifice weak
mortals with their feeble intellect do not comprehend,
Agni, the priest, who knows all rights, comprehends it,
makes it all good.”<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The whole question of sacrifices is still hotly discussed;
whether they preceded or followed prayer. Did the Vedic
poets wait till the ceremonial was fully developed before
they invoked the Powers, or did their prayers suggest the
performance of sacrificial acts?</p>

<p>“Agni, accept this branch that I offer. Accept this my
service&mdash;listen well to these my songs. Whosoever sacrifices
to Agni with a stick of wood, with a libation, with a
bundle of herbs, or with an inclination of his head, he will
be blessed.”<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>We nowhere hear of a mute sacrifice. That which we
call a sacrifice the ancients called simply <em>karma</em>, an act;
a simple prayer, preceded by a washing of the hands, or
accompanied by an inclination of the head, may constitute
a <em>karma</em>, an act; to light the fire on the hearth, to bow
the head and utter the name of Agni with some kind<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
epithet, might also be termed an act. At first the sacrifice
may only have been a prayer accompanied by a gift. They
may originally have been inseparable, but in all this there
is nothing opposed to the idea that it would be in accordance
with human nature that prayer should come first.
In time the act of sacrifice assumed a sacred and solemn
character. In the earlier vocabularies of the Aryan tongues
the word sacrifice does not occur; the Sanscrit and Zend
root of the word are almost identical, and these languages
furnish many words indicative of minute detail of ancient
ceremonial. From this may be inferred that a hymn full
of allusions to the celebrations of sacrifices must date from
a period posterior to the separation of the families.</p>

<p>“Agni, drive away from us the enemies&mdash;tribes who
keep no fire came to attack us.”<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>When the Aryans of Asia abandoned their first habitation,
and advanced southwards plundering as they went,
they encountered some of the aborigines of the country,
whose territory they coveted. They were wild tribes; the
descriptions given by the rishis evidently refer to the
aborigines of India, whose descendants survive to the
present day, speaking non-Aryan dialects. The epithets
of devil and demon are freely used concerning them in the
hymns. But apparently in their encounters Agni, who
opposes these hostile foes, by appearing under the form of
flaming torches, is not successful in overcoming them,
since the Aryans implore the aid of other allies. They
invoke the help of the two chief warlike powers, Indra
and Soma, to destroy those “who worship other gods, who
do not speak the truth, and who eat raw meat.”<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>“O Indra and Soma, burn the devils, throw them
down&mdash;they who grow in darkness&mdash;tear them off, the
madmen, kill them, slay the gluttons. O Indra and
Soma, up against the cursing demon&mdash;may he burn like
an oblation in the fire. Pour your everlasting hatred<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
upon the villain who hates the Brahman, who eats raw
flesh, and who looks abominable.”<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Of Soma, who lends such capable aid to Agni when repulsing
the enemies of the Aryans, the Hindoos have four
different conceptions. Soma is sometimes the moon, the
abode of the fathers. Soma is also the lord of the moon.
Soma is the bowl containing the drink of the gods, ambrosia.
Soma is sometimes ambrosia itself. The etymology
of the word indicates homonymy; originally it meant rain
and the moon. Ambrosia was a type of the rain fertilising
the earth, yet being at the same time a strengthening
draught. It is sometimes quite impossible to decide of
which Soma the rishis are speaking, especially as they
seem to find pleasure in confounding the terms. This
play upon words fills almost the whole of one book of the
<cite>Rig-Veda</cite>.</p>

<p>“Meditate on the wisdom of Soma (moon) in all its
greatness&mdash;yesterday it was dead, to-day it is living.”</p>

<p>“The poet has swallowed Soma (the juice), he has felt
an overpowering inspiration&mdash;he has found his hymn.”</p>

<p>The exalted virtues of Soma have raised it to the rank
of those divinities who dispense immortality.</p>

<p>“Where there is eternal light, in the world where the
sun is placed, in that immortal, imperishable world place
me, O Soma, where life is free, in the third heaven of
heavens, there make me immortal.”<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>What is the third heaven? It is an expression with
which we are familiar, but what does it mean? The
Aryans also call the children of Rudra to their help; they
are allied to Indra and are called Maruts. They fill the
air with alarming sounds; these noise-producing beings
are the representatives of storms and tempests, they never
appear alone in the Veda, they traverse space in groups of
from twenty-five to eighty in number, and they make the
earth tremble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>“Where are you going? towards whom do you go when
you descend from on high like a blast of fire? May
power be with thee and thy race, O Rudra. Come to us,
Maruts, come and help us as quickly as lightning before
the rain! Let loose, O devourer, your anger like an arrow
against the proud enemy of the poets.”<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A deep problem now presents itself. What was there
before anything existed? Two contradictory ideas appear
in the hymns, and the conflict must have been trying.</p>

<p>“Sages have said: In the beginning the world was&mdash;a
single world&mdash;there was not a second. Others have said:
In the beginning this world had no existence, and out of
nothing, what now is, came.”</p>

<p>Much confusion of thought reigned in the human mind.
The world must surely have been made from something,
and by certain agents; but then, how were the agents
themselves formed? and what material served them for the
making of the world?</p>

<p>Other questions followed. “Who has seen the firstborn?
Where was the life, the blood, the soul of the
world? Who went to ask this from any that knew it?
What was the forest? what was the tree out of which
they shaped heaven and earth? Ye wise, seek in your
mind on what he stood when he held the world.”<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Our ancestors would not have been human if they had
not yielded to the temptation of representing the invisible
makers of the world by some personality. They therefore
speak of carpenters and workmen “who have cunning
hands; clever artificers who forge the lightning.” Is it
those who have made all that is visible? They know not.
It is certain that in speaking of carpenters, workmen,
thunderers, tearers, rainers, men approached, perhaps unconsciously,
the domain of causes, which from the beginning
has been the ancient foundation of all that is transcendental<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
in our knowledge. It could not be otherwise,
since our reason is so constituted that it admits nothing
but what is either cause or effect.</p>

<p>There are thoughts to be found in the Veda which are
excessively infantine, but again there are others of astonishing
subtlety; perhaps they date from different epochs; but
individualities are apparent in these hymns, and they
anticipated by many centuries the greater number of
contemporary writers who followed at a slower pace. The
rishis who said, “There is one Being only, although the
poets call him by a thousand names,” perfectly expressed
this truth; and the Hindoos for centuries have invoked
Indra, Mitra, Agni, and Savitar, though the more profound
thinkers have protested against the traditional use of these
names, just as Heracleitus 500 years before our era objected
to the thousand names, the thousand temples, and the
thousand legends of the Greek mythology.</p>

<p>The rishis in asking themselves how all things began
were not content with representing the world as coming
from the hands of clever workmen, were they even invisible;
it was no great labour to discover that; but at
times they had profounder thoughts. The sacred literatures
of many ancient peoples have reached us, in fragments
more or less complete; but the meditations which
can equal those in the hymn 129 are rare.</p>

<p>“The One in the form of the Un-born was not&mdash;the
luminous firmament existed not&mdash;nor the great vault of
heaven&mdash;where was he hidden? Was it in the bottomless
abyss? Death existed not&mdash;nor immortality. There
was no distinction between day and night. The One
breathed breathless by itself. Other than it there nothing
since has been. There was darkness then; everything in
the beginning was hidden in gloom&mdash;all was like the
ocean, without a light. Then that germ which was
covered by the husk&mdash;the One&mdash;was brought forth by the
power of heat. On this germ was love&mdash;the springtime<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
of the spirit&mdash;yes. And the poets whilst meditating upon
it, discovered in their soul the link between created things
and things not created. This spark, comes it from the
earth&mdash;piercing all&mdash;penetrating through all&mdash;or comes
it from the sky? There seeds were scattered, and powerful
forces came into being; nature beneath, will and power
above. Who knows the secret&mdash;who proclaimed whence
this manifold creation sprang? The gods themselves came
later into being; who knows whence this great creation
sprang? He from whom all this great creation came&mdash;whether
his will created or was mute. He, the most
high seer, that is in highest heaven, he knows it&mdash;or
perchance even he knows not.”</p>

<p>“Who knows whence this great creation sprang?” the
Hindoos asked themselves, thousands of years before our
era; and again, “What was the forest, what was the tree,
from which they cut out heaven and earth? What was
there before anything existed?” These questions, differently
expressed, are found in many places in the Veda; every
kind of problem is presented to us under the form of
enigmas. The Hindoos seem to have had an idea that
the visible world was preceded by something invisible, yet
much more real than the world of phenomena in which we
live; and that before apparitions existed, there was that
which appeared afterwards in time and space.</p>

<p>These same questions will constantly be repeated in
changing terms, through the coming centuries, whilst a
heaven and earth remain.</p>

<p>The problem which occupied the powerful intellects of
Hume and Kant, and which these philosophers named the
principle of causality, was already exercising the brains of
our fathers when they gave names for the first time to the
sky, the sun, the dawn, and the other physical phenomena,
by means of roots indicating activity; for the principle of
causality manifested itself in the beginning, not in the
direct search for a cause, but in the assertion of the existence<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
of an agent. This mental labour, commenced and
accomplished thousands of centuries ago by millions of
human beings, deserves at least as much attention from
us as the learned speculations of two modern philosophers,
be they Hume or Kant.</p>

<p>So striking an object as the sun, even before possessing
a definite name, must have been designated in some special
way; perhaps as a simple circle, such as we find in the
Egyptian hieroglyphics, in the Chinese writing, and in our
astronomical almanacs; this symbol would give little
opportunities to the mythologists; but when the idea
arose that the sun was a ball, and that an analogy was
found between a ball and an eye, man began to speak of
the sun as the eye of the sky. We say readily in all
languages, “God is omniscient,” but Hesiod, to express
the same truth said, “The sun is the eye of Zeus who
sees and knows all.” If the language appears childish to
us, we must remember that it was the expression of a poet
who lived long before the philosophers of Greece, we shall
then be less struck by its harshness than by the happy
and pure thought which has been expressed.</p>

<p>The sun has been an object of adoration with many of
the primitive nations; it seems uncertain whether as the
divinity himself or as his representative; most of the
mythologists assure us that the ancient Egyptians worshipped
the sun’s disc itself. The first step is invariably
followed by a second, and a good example of development
in religious belief is afforded by a Mexican legend. The
story is told of the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, who, though
reputed a son of the sun, began to doubt the divine
omnipotence of his divine ancestor. At a great religious
council, held at the consecration of the newly built temple
of the sun at Cuzco, he rose before the assembled multitude
to deny the divinity of the sun. “Many say,” he
began, “that the sun is the maker of all things. But he
who makes should abide by what he has made. Now<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
many things happen when the sun is absent; therefore he
cannot be the universal Creator. And that he is alive at
all, is doubtful, for his journeys do not tire him. He is
like a tethered beast who makes a daily round; he is like
an arrow which must go whither it is sent, not whither
it wishes. I tell you that he, our father and maker&mdash;the
sun&mdash;must have a lord and master more powerful than
himself, who constrains him to his daily circuit without
pause or rest.”<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>We can follow in the Vedic hymns the gradual development
which changes the sun from a simple luminary, and
the giver of daily light and life, to the preserver and ruler
of the world. He who brings life and light to-day, is the
same who brought life and light on the first of days; as
he drives away the darkness of night, and as “the stars
flee before the all-seeing sun, like thieves,” the eye fixed
on men&mdash;the sun&mdash;sees the right and wrong and knows
their thoughts.</p>

<p>Almost all peoples have raised their eyes to the sky,
the abode of the invisible Powers; and our ancestors,
who addressed such fervent prayers to all the phenomena
of nature could not fail to invoke it. But the sky shows
itself under very varying aspects, it is sometimes the sky
dazzling with light, then there is the lowering sky, or the
sky that thunders, that rains; each time that it varies
it changes its name; and these names must be known to
man since it is always invoked under the special denomination
of the power he is about to address. Varuna is one
of the names of the sky, his physical characteristic reflects
it, it is the vast vault or covering which protects the
whole earth and its inhabitants; it is also the sky which
is itself obscured when the sun disappears. In the Veda,
Varuna is associated with Mitra, the light, thus giving
rise to a concept of correlative gods representing night and
day, morning and evening, heaven and earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>“He who should flee far beyond the sky&mdash;even he
would not be rid of Varuna, the king. King Varuna sees
all this, what is between heaven and earth, and what is
beyond. This earth, too, belongs to Varuna, the king,
and this wide sky with its ends far apart. The two seas
are Varuna’s loins; he is also contained in this small drop
of water.”</p>

<p>“The great lord of these worlds sees as if he were near:
if a man stands or walks, if he goes to lie down or to get
up, if he thinks he is walking by stealth, the god Varuna
knows it all. What two people sitting together whisper,
King Varuna knows it, he is there as the third.”<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The prayers of the rishis overflow with the acknowledgment
of their sins, and their belief that the gods have
the power to deliver them from the burden of their faults.</p>

<p>“Let me not yet, O Varuna, enter into the house of
clay (earth). Have mercy, Almighty, have mercy. If I
move along trembling, like a cloud driven by the wind,
have mercy. Through want of strength, have I gone
astray, thou strong and bright god, have mercy. Thirst
came upon the worshipper, though he stood in the midst
of the waters&mdash;have mercy, Almighty, have mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It is noticeable that in the Hindoo mind the sun, in
its many manifestations, is sometimes synonymous with
the firmament: Indra, as the illuminator of the zenith;
Savitar, as the bestower of life; Mitra, as the friend of
humanity; the indefatigable Agni, so modest but so active,
in cooking the food and smelting iron, so powerful when
it bears the smoke of the sacrifices heavenwards, and so
exalted when it takes its place in the sun and descends in
the form of lightning; and the spacious firmament which
holds them all in its bosom; they are all one to the
adorer of the divine powers; all are equally marvellous, it
is a galaxy of brilliance. What innumerable gods, and
not one to whom it could be said, “Deliver us from evil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>Urged on by an irresistible curiosity the rishis ceaselessly
probe into the unknown and the distant.</p>

<p>“Beyond the sky, beyond the earth, beyond the Devas
and the Asuras, what was the first germ which the waters
bore, wherein all gods were seen? The waters bore that
first germ in which all the gods came together. That
<em>one</em> thing in which all creatures rested was placed in the
lap of the unborn. You will never know him who
created these things, something else stands between you
and Him. Enveloped in mist and with faltering voices,
the poets walk along rejoicing in life.”<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>How was it that in the midst of the magnificence of
their immense Pantheon, the poets succeeded in obtaining
glimpses of the <em>One</em>. Who was He? The mists surround
Him and prevent Him being clearly discerned.</p>

<p>If there was one thing in nature more adapted than
another to satisfy the desire of bridging over the limits of
the visible world, it was certainly the vault of heaven;
above the storms and clouds which are temporary, beyond
all that is changeable; amongst all the changing objects
which meet the eyes, surely the firmament was the most
exalted, the most extended, and immovable. We know
the genealogy of the name of the sky, Dyaus, which
enables us to trace the transformations and subsequent
applications; and as we advance we shall glean some
particulars of that science which at a later date was
called grammar.</p>

<p>It is known that in the Aryan languages some of the
oldest words are without gender; speaking grammatically,
pater is not a masculine, nor mater a feminine; nor do
the oldest words for river, mountain, tree, or sky, disclose
any outward sign of grammatical gender. But though
without any signs of gender, all ancient nouns expressed
activity. The distinction of gender began, not with the
introduction of masculine nouns, but with the setting<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
apart of certain derivative suffixes for feminine words;
thus when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona</i> was introduced, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonus</i> became masculine;
when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puella</i> could be applied to a girl, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puer</i>, which
formerly meant both boy and girl, became restricted to
the meaning of boy. Therefore, whenever it happens that
we have a female representative of a natural phenomenon
by the side of a male, the female may almost always be
taken as the later form. This rule, which has been
strictly applied to the name of Dyaus, dates from so
remote a time that its origin is lost in the mists of ages.</p>

<p>Dyaus, like <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">deva</i>, shining, comes from the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i> or
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i>, but this root bifurcates at once. In the Rig-Veda
forms derived from the base <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i> are masculine or feminine
as the case may be, whilst those which are derived from
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i> are always masculine; thus <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyaus</i> from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i>, is the
firmament, the expanse above our heads, and is the later
feminine form; whereas <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyaus</i> from <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i>, is the sky considered
as a power, an active force, and is masculine, and
consequently is the earlier conception. These two words,
<i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyaus</i>, nominative singular, and its base, <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i>, being almost
synonymous may be used indifferently.</p>

<p>All vegetable cells are destined to become plants,
though sometimes different plants, this, observation of
nature teaches us. All verbal cells are destined to
become words, though differing, that is, with different
meanings; the small amount of philological study to
which we have already devoted ourselves in these pages
shows us this. All cells, whatever their nature, possess a
transitive movement; the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclater</i> has the
meaning of to disperse in brilliancy; if we imagine
scintillations of light escaping from a central luminary we
obtain the idea of a transitive luminous movement.
Whilst a cell preserves its primary condition it is not
possible to predict its future; no human intelligence
could have foretold that the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i> and <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dyu</i> would
produce the Sanscrit word deva, which means to shine,<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
and deva would in time develop into deus, which now no
longer means to shine, but God. It is a curious characteristic
of Vedic Sanscrit that this uncertainty of
meaning of such words as deva, which expresses equally the
half physical and half spiritual intention, is an evidence of
its rays having proceeded from the same source of light
and heat.</p>

<p>Human reason, in finding its way amongst crooked
paths, often wanders; the representations it makes of
things are coloured by rays projected by mythological or
dogmatic mirages. We may recognise in the manner in
which our ancestors have viewed the supernatural powers
the prototype of our own errors of judgment. From the
time that Dyaus became the warming, life-giving sky and
thus active, the rishis were authorised to call him pitar,
father, and to place by his side Prithvi, the earth, who is
the mother, and they then spoke of Dyaus as the father
of the dawn, and of day and night. These were thus
considered as the first attributes of the sky in Aryan
mythology.</p>

<p>We are inclined to ascribe these excursions of thought
to the flights of poetic fancy, but they are rather the
results of the poverty of language, which make it impossible
not only to express abstract ideas, but even to
describe accurately the phenomena of the physical world.
Religion and language in those days were so closely allied
that it is possible to say of a religious idea in its infancy
that it was a fragment of ancient language; for in order
to describe his impressions the Aryan depended entirely
on the words with which it furnished him. For this
reason many of the hymns, incoherent though they may
appear, are of inestimable value. Every one of their
words weighs and tells, but for the translator who endeavours
to present the Vedic thought in modern idioms, the
results are so discouraging that he is tempted to give up
in despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>When at a later date the name of Dyaus became the
centre of fabulous tales, it still remained in the Sanscrit
language of that time one of the many traditional and
unmeaning words for sky; but we must understand clearly
that in the most ancient hymns of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> this
name is the incarnation of the Power which is beyond and
above conception, whose existence had been obscurely
indicated from the beginning, and who remained unnamed
long after the beasts of the forests and the birds of the
air had received their appellations.</p>

<p>From the time of their exodus the Aryan family, going
in different directions, were naturally divided into branches;
vast distances separated them, and they forgot that the
same cradle, the same hearth, had sheltered them at birth.
But the ties which connected them originally were not
snapped at all points, since they brought away with them
words belonging to their mother-tongue, and certain intuitions
were the common property of all. Before the Greek,
Latin, Sanscrit, and German languages became separated,
the name of a sovereign Power was implied in those of
the divinity which at a much later time occupied so large
a space in the history of Greece, Rome, India, and of
Germany.</p>

<p>Coupled with the word <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">pitar</i> the name Dyaus appears
in the most ancient Aryan prayers as Dyaush-pitar, Zeus-pater,
and Ju-piter. These composite names are no invention
of the poets; they are the results of certain laws of
language to which our minds&mdash;if they would not turn
from the right path&mdash;must submit. The initial <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">dy</i> in
Dyaus is represented in Latin by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">j</i>; Ju in Jupiter corresponds
exactly with Dyaus. The name of the Teutonic
god Tyr, genitive Tys, also corresponds, and as exactly,
with Dyaus; in Gothic it would be Tius, and in Anglo-Saxon
Tiw, preserved in Tiwsdæg, the day of the god
Tyr, and Zio in Old High-German, where we find Ziestac
for the modern Dienstag, the day of the god Mars. Tius,<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
Tiw, Tyr, and Zio are forms that exist side by side, all of
which of course proceed from that wonderful root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">div</i>,
and represent the bright sky, day, and god. No etymological
interpretation would be satisfying which did not
embrace all these forms, since they are all dialectic variations
of Dyaus, the same name in different languages. All
names truly related have but one root, in the same way as
living beings who are brothers have but one mother.</p>

<p>If another proof were needed of the uninterrupted continuity
of speech and thought amongst the chief of the
Aryan people, the following fact will afford it:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the time when the schools flourished in Athens, and
when the Greeks were hardly conscious of the existence of
India, it would have been possible, I suppose, to see young
pupils seated before tables on which the master had written
the declensions which composed the task for the day. There
might be read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="boxitlist1">
<p class="pminus1"><em>Nom.</em> Zeús<br />
<em>Gen.</em> Dios<br />
<em>Dat.</em> Dii<br />
<em>Acc.</em> Dia<br />
<em>Voc.</em> Zeû</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the young Athenians wrote the name of Zeus with
an acute accent in the nominative, and a circumflex in the
vocative.</p>

<p>At the same time the pupils of the Brahmans at
Benares, when declining the name of their supreme deity,
accented the syllables exactly in the same way as the
Greeks, and they wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="boxitlist1">
<p class="pminus1"><em>Nom.</em> Dyaús<br />
<em>Gen.</em> Dyvas<br />
<em>Dat.</em> Divi<br />
<em>Acc.</em> Divam<br />
<em>Voc.</em> Dyaûs</p>
</div>

<p>But there was this difference between the Grecian pupils<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
and the Hindoos, that the former were ignorant of the
reason of these changes of accent, since the explanation
was lacking in the Greek grammar, whereas the Sanscrit
grammar explained to the latter the general principles of
accentuation on which the changes rested.</p>

<p>The name of Dyaus was the source from which sprang
an unique name, coined once and for ever, adopted by our
entire family; the Greeks have no more borrowed it from
the Hindoos, than the Romans and the Teutons from the
Greeks; for it was pronounced before the separation of our
ancestors with regard to language or religion; its meaning
was Heaven-Father.</p>

<p>Our missionaries who go from one end of the earth to
the other, reciting the Lord’s Prayer in all the dialects of
the world, do not doubt the historical fact that this prayer
was said one day at Jerusalem for the first time; we also
may feel as profoundly convinced that under the name of
Heaven-Father, the Supreme Being has been worshipped
on the Himalayan mountains, under the oaks of Dodona,
on the Capitol, and in the forests of Germany. It has
required millions of men to fashion this name alone, which
is the most ancient prayer of the Aryan race.</p>

<p>“Five thousand years have passed, perhaps more, since
the Asiatic Aryans, speaking as yet neither Sanscrit,
Greek, nor Latin, called upon the All-Father as Dyu-patar,
Heaven-Father. Four thousand years ago, or it
may be earlier, the Aryans who had travelled southwards
to the rivers of the Punjaub called him Dyaush-pita, the
Heaven-Father. Three thousand years ago, or it may
be earlier, the Aryans on the shores of the Hellespont
called him Zeus-pater, Heaven-Father. Two thousand
years ago the Aryans of Italy looked up to that bright
Heaven above and called it Ju-piter, the Heaven-Father.
And a thousand years ago the same Heaven-Father was
invoked in the dark forests of Germany, since the Teutonic
Aryans sacrificed to the same Heaven-Father; and his<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
old name of Tyr, Tiu, or Zio resounded then perhaps for
the last time.</p>

<p>“But no thought, no name, has ever been entirely lost.”<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Some thousands of years have elapsed since these
families have spread abroad on all sides; each branch
has formed its own language, its own nationality, its
mode of viewing life, and its philosophies; temples have
been built and razed to the ground; since then all have
aged, all are wiser, perhaps better, but the name which
they gave to the Invisible Power who enfolds them is still
the same, “Our Father which art in Heaven.”</p>

<p>This name, whose unity has always been perfect, is a
magical formula, which brings our ancestors, even the
most remote, within touch, and enables us to see them
as they were, as they spoke and felt, thousands of years
before Homer and the Hindoo poets. Guided by the
science of language and following the path in the Vedic
hymns taken by the humanity preceding us, we see how
the concept of God, in its germ in the name Deva, grew
from the idea of light, to active light, the one who wakens,
the giver of daily light, of warmth and new life.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the difference between these
two assertions&mdash;first of this one&mdash;that the early Aryans
called the phenomena of nature themselves by the name
of God; and the other&mdash;that the Aryan mind distilled
from the concept of these phenomena the general idea
of God.</p>

<p>“If I were asked,” said Max Müller, “which is the
most wonderful discovery of the nineteenth century in
the history of humanity, I should reply it is that of the
etymological equation of the Sanscrit Dyaush-pitar, the
Greek Zeus-pater, the Latin Ju-piter, and Tyr, Tiw, and
Zio of the Germans.”</p>

<p>That the generality of people should be inconsequent
is not a matter of surprise. He may well be pardoned<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
who does not at once, on the word of another, credit a
number of facts of which no proofs are forthcoming, and
who at the same time shows himself unwilling to accept
the deductions of a science of which he knows nothing,
that of etymology; but what does seem strange is that
learned scholars who are perfectly capable of following the
progress made by philology, refuse to recognise the identity
of the different names given to the supreme deity of the
Aryan race. Certain positivists are in this case; nothing
irritates them more than to offer them grammatical proof
that all the Aryan families had, before their separation, the
same belief; and they try to demonstrate that the name of
Dyaus at the first meant nothing more than the sky; and
that only at a later period people had changed the name
of sky and of firmament&mdash;physical phenomena only&mdash;into
proper names which transformed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina</i> into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">numina</i>.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that this assertion is founded on
a fact, but a fact not well understood. In the later literature
of India which was known before the Veda became
so much studied, the name of Dyaus was only known as
a feminine; it was the recognised name for sky and day,
and implied nothing divine. The ancient Aryan Dyaus
after a time paled before Indra&mdash;a god of Indian soil;
Indra, formerly the rain-giver&mdash;the ally of Rudra&mdash;ceased
to reside exclusively in the more menacing phenomena of
the atmosphere, and it is the pure light in which he is
worshipped. He is now supreme.</p>

<p>“Before Indra the divine Dyu bowed, before Indra
bowed the great Prithivi.”<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In order duly to celebrate Indra, the rishis did not
content themselves with the praises they considered fitting
for the other gods. They laboured hard to find the right
expression and every hymn is a heroic feat.</p>

<p>“The other gods were sent away like shrivelled up old
men; thou, O Indra, becamest the king. No one is<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
beyond thee, no one is better than thou art, no one is like
unto thee. Keep silence well! we offer our praises to
the great Indra in the house of the sacrificer. Does
he find treasure for those who are like sleepers? Mean
praise is not valued among the munificent.”<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>It is strange that it is in connection with the great
Indra, the most popular of all the gods of India, that
indications of a struggle between faith and doubt are
apparent in the praises addressed to him. The existence
of the other divinities was as firmly established as the
splendour of the sun and stars, as the appearances of fire,
the movements of the winds, the impressions made by
heat and cold; and the confidence they inspired was too
firmly established to require stimulating; and then
suddenly we find the rishis discoursing on and enumerating
the reasons that exist for man’s belief in Indra.</p>

<p>“When the fiery Indra hurls down the thunder-bolt,
then people put faith in him. Look at this his great and
mighty work, and believe in his great power.”</p>

<p>Whence came this insistence to recall the great power
of Indra? It almost suggests the thought that the rishis
felt the approach of a change in their conception of the
omnipotence of some of the gods of nature.</p>

<p>“Offer praise to Indra, if you desire booty; true praise,
if he truly exists. One and the other says, There is no
Indra, who has seen him? Whom shall we praise? The
terrible one of whom they ask where he is.”<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>But the poet at once introduces Indra on the scene, and
makes him say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Here I am, O worshipper! behold me here.
</div><div class="indent0">In might I overcome all creatures.”&mdash;Id.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>In reading the Rig-Veda attentively, in spite of these
efforts to revive the ancient faith, here and there can be
discovered slight traces of scepticism, so slight as to be<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
scarcely perceptible, and these apart from the incredulity
exhibited concerning the powerful Indra. The Hindoo
was by nature profoundly believing, but his intellect was
subtle and scrutinising, and he considered it due to himself
to give exact explanations of all; the rishis make the
following true remarks.</p>

<p>“Fire is quenched by water, a cloud hides the sun, the
sun also disappears behind the sea;” and from these
observations they draw the following conclusions.</p>

<p>“Water must not be worshipped, since a cloud can
carry it away; nor the cloud, since the wind can disperse
it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The positivists have made too much of the fact that
Dyaus, at one time in India, meant simply the sky and
day; a rock is not more immovable than grammar, and it
is moreover quite indifferent to all blows aimed at truths
other than it holds.</p>

<p>Certain scholars in their researches after the origin of
Aryan divinities, were surprised and somewhat disconcerted
at a gap which confronted them and prevented further
progress; nowhere in the later literature of India could
any trace be found of Dyaus as a god who could correspond
to the supreme divinity of the other branches of the
family. However, the very rational conviction that this
deity must have existed gradually strengthened in the
minds of the learned. They were thus at a standstill,
when the Veda appeared under the strong light of modern
investigation and brought to view the name of Dyaus
totally different from the feminine dyaus, a Dyaus presenting
in itself, not merely the masculine substantive,
but joined with pita&mdash;father. Amongst the Hindoos it
had paled before Indra, who was a god of later date, but
the other Aryan races had been uninfluenced by this.
Dyaus, the chief god, had accompanied them in their
migrations, and Zeus-pater, Ju-piter, Tyr, Tiw, and Zio,<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
became the exact representative of him, each in a different
country; this discovery of Dyaush-pita, was like finding at
last a star in the very place of the heavens which had
been fixed before by calculation, but where previously
there had been a void.</p>

<p>This was not the only discovery due to the study of
the Veda. No one could ignore the fact, that amongst
the Hindoos dyaus was the name of the sky, since it bears
in itself the root which attests this; but it would have
been impossible to discover the radical or predicative
meaning of Zeus by the help of Greek alone; it possesses
no certificate of birth, and the Greeks had no traditions
connected with it that could have taught us. With the
help of comparative philology all is made plain; Zeus
was born when Dyaus was recognised as masculine and
called father, Dyaush-pitar, Ju-piter, Zeus-pater, and from
the moment that we are made acquainted with the origin
of Zeus, the rest of his career unrolls before us.</p>

<p>Our ancestors, however, had still a long time to wander
in the wilderness of error, and lost themselves many
times.</p>

<p>The Hindoos thought for a time that they had found in
Dyaus the object of their search; but the supernatural
light and the light of day became confounded; when the
word Dyaus was pronounced, the many natural bright
objects it might signify all vibrated in response and
melted into one; they became&mdash;as a double star does&mdash;one
object, and Dyu, the god of light, was eclipsed behind
dyu the sky.</p>

<p>When the question was asked for the first time whence
came the rain, the lightning, and the thunder, those who
inhabited Italy replied that rain came from Jupiter
Pluvius, the lightning from Jupiter fulminator and
fulgurator, the thunder from Jupiter tonans. In Greece
all that concerned the higher regions of the atmosphere
was attributed to Zeus; it was Zeus who rained, who<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
snowed, thundered, gathered the clouds, let loose the
tempests, held the rainbow in his hand; many legends
were grouped around these divine names; the more
incomprehensible they were, the more eagerly were they
heard, until it is very doubtful whether any trace remains
of that Being who at the first gave to the name of the sky
its highest signification.</p>

<p>A characteristic trait of the Hindoos, which is noticeable
in the hymns, is a tendency to praise all by which they
are surrounded. Not satisfied with celebrating the virtues
of the invisible beings, which they imagine to be behind
the semi-tangible and intangible objects such as mountains,
rivers, trees, fire, the sun, storms, etc., the rishis, carried
away by the ardour of their feelings, glorify objects which
are perfectly tangible, even those which they may have
made with their own hands, or those which at least have
nothing mysterious in them; these are termed <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">devatas</i>,
and the commentator explains that by this word is meant
the person or thing addressed; thus the victims to be
offered, or a sacrificial vessel, or a battle-axe or shield, all
these are called devatas; in some dialogues found in the
hymns whoever speaks is called the rishi, whoever is
spoken to is the devata.</p>

<p>“The late Herbert Spencer relates that even in our
days the Hindoo offers prayers to the objects which he
uses; a woman adores the basket which she takes to the
market and offers sacrifices to it, as well as to the other
implements which assist her in her household labours. A
carpenter pays the like homage to his hatchet, the mason
to his trowel, and the Brahman to the style with which
he is going to write. The question is, in what sense did
the author of <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite> use the word
adore?”<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The desire to have an exact account of what is happening
alternates with the prayers and adoration; the<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
questions and praises interlace like the threads of a
web.</p>

<p>“Unsupported, not fastened, how does he (the sun)
rising up, not fall down?”</p>

<p>The poet is also anxious to know how the dawn and
the sun appear each morning; how there is so much
rain, also such an abundance of rivers and streams.</p>

<p>“How many fires are there, how many dawns, how
many suns, and how many waters? I do not say this, O
fathers, to worry you; I ask you, O seers, that I may
know.”</p>

<p>The explanation also is desired by these enquirers how
it is that a red or brown cow can give white milk.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The
rishis are rigorous logicians, and consider that the powerful
divinities who made the world such as it is might
have done better; and they do not scruple to communicate
their opinion to whom it concerns. “If we
were as rich as you we should not allow our worshippers
to beg their bread.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><a id="p_chapter"></a>It has been asked whether humanity commenced by
having a monotheistic or a polytheistic religion. This is
not the first time that this question has been propounded;
it has as an antecedent a very ancient opinion, developed
in the schools of theology in the Middle Ages; the Fathers
of the Church gave it as their opinion that a faith in one
God, from the days of the greatest antiquity, had been the
glorious heritage of the Semitic family, coming in a direct
line from the first man. But these same theologians
considered Hebrew to be the primitive language of the<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
human race, an assertion now known to be erroneous.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
We may therefore subject the first assertion to an
examination.</p>

<p>The learned writers who dispute on the original form of
religious thought forget that the ancient Aryans could
not have been either monotheistic or polytheistic. The
Vedic hymns show us that though there were many gods,
and that they were equal, yet whilst the worshipper was
addressing one, the rest were excluded from his mind,
and were as though they did not exist; each god became
in turn the Supreme Power, and received the highest
praise; the rishis, who had represented the sun under
the names of Vishnu, Varuna, Mitra, Savitar as the
creator of the world, spoke of it immediately afterwards
as the child of the waters, born of the dawn, a god among
other gods, neither better nor worse; it is this characteristic
of the Aryan religion, this worship offered alternately to
different divinities to which Max Müller has given the
name of Henotheism.</p>

<p>“Among you, O gods, there is none that is great, and
none that is little&mdash;none old or young&mdash;you are all great
indeed.”</p>

<p>The religion of humanity in its entirety at the beginning
was this intuition of the divine, whose formula is
that article of faith, at once the simplest and the most
important&mdash;God is God&mdash;the want of definiteness in it
making it the more applicable to the dawn of thought.<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
This primitive intuition of God was in itself neither monotheistic
nor polytheistic, though it might become either
according to the expression which it took in the language
of man; in no language does the plural exist before the
singular; no human mind could have conceived the idea
of gods without having previously conceived the idea of
one God. “It would be, however, quite as great a mistake
to imagine, because the idea of a god must exist
previously to that of gods, that therefore a belief in one
God preceded everywhere the belief in many gods. A
belief in God, as exclusively One, involves a distinct negation
of more than one God, and that negation is possible
only after the conception, whether real or imaginary, of
many gods.”<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> If therefore an expression had been given
to this primitive intuition of the Deity, which is the
mainspring of all later religion, it would have been,
“There is a God,” but certainly not yet, “There is but one
God.”</p>

<p>These fine distinctions require close attention to grasp
them; the fact that in our modern tongues we have
derived the singular <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Theos</i> from the Greek plural <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Theoi</i> has
caused confusion; from a historical point of view, no
doubt Theos has come from Theoi; but putting this
aside, the meaning of the word has gone through as complete
a transformation as that of the acorn to the oak;
the evidence of this change has been so deeply impressed
even on our outward senses that as soon as our intellect
has attained some measure of development the sound of
the word God used in the plural jars on our ears as if we
heard of two universes or one twin.</p>

<p>The Hindoo mind, however, oscillated between the
representation of many gods and of one only God; and
the rishis appear to have attempted to establish a sort of
priority amongst their numerous deities.</p>

<p>“That which is one, the seers call in many ways; they<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
speak of Indra, Mitra, Agni, and Varuna&mdash;they call it by
various names&mdash;that which is, and is one.”</p>

<p>“In the evening Agni becomes Varuna&mdash;he becomes
Mitra when rising in the mornings; having become
Savitri, he passes through the sky&mdash;having become Indra
he warms the heaven in the centre.”<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>This attempt, which might have led to monotheism,
came to nothing; on this point the Hindoos were behind
the Greeks and Romans, who with their polytheism had a
presiding deity, viz., Zeus and Jupiter.</p>

<p>“When we thus see the god Dyaus antiquated by
Indra, and Indra himself almost denied, we might expect
in India the same catastrophe which in Iceland the poets
of the Edda always predicted&mdash;the twilight of the gods
preceding the destruction of the world. We seem to have
reached the stage when henotheism, after trying in vain to
grow into an organised polytheism on the one side, or into
an exclusive monotheism on the other, would by necessity
end in atheism; yet atheism is not the last word of the
Indian religion.”<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>This question: “What is atheism?” has aroused me with
a start. Led aside as I had been by many beautiful,
true, and striking thoughts, which I noted as they presented
themselves to me; being also very preoccupied by
depressing observations that I had made on my chronic
inability to turn them to account, I lost sight of the fact
that it is not sufficient to write and think at will merely,
without definite plan, not keeping the goal in sight. This
is my eleventh chapter, and I see with dismay that it is
likely to exceed the two which precede it in length, and
that it follows one concerned more with the repetition of
words often spoken and seldom understood. I fear that I
lack method.</p>

<p>During our own time we have seen a school arise, the
Historical School; it was heralded in Germany by such
men as Niebuhr, the two Humboldts, Bopp&mdash;the author
of the first Comparative Grammar&mdash;Grimm, and many
others. This School shows that an uninterrupted continuity
connects what has been thought of old with what
is being thought at present; that there is no break
between the present and the past; and that the difficulties
which are presented to us by the study of the present
philosophical problems, would in a great measure disappear,<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
if we knew under what form these same problems presented
themselves to man for the first time.</p>

<p>The Historical School advances step by step with the
study of comparative philology; this latter has shown
that at the beginning the number of words was very
small; they lay, as it were, side by side, before man’s
eyes, as evenly and as regularly as the threads on a
weaver’s loom. But gradually, on account of our neglect,
and our many misunderstandings, the idea contained in
these words became entangled, and we have ceased to
follow the course of the thread; the words have remained
in our memory, but the meaning has changed; they may
even have several meanings which contradict each other;
the result is that we are ignorant of many things it would
be well for us to know with certainty.</p>

<p>All problems whether of philosophy or of philology, are
best solved by the historical method; let us bravely face
each obscure question to which we have no key; each
doubtful term the meaning of which is lost, and bid all
retrace their steps in the path by which they arrived
at us; avoiding the peril of the idle worker who has a
theory, and a remedy ready for everything; and the
walks in the country of dreams which have no chart to
direct travellers.</p>

<p>For us who are not learned linguists there is more
than one method of gaining information concerning words;
the easiest is to note the use made of them at various
times in the past; another way which is more important
and more certain is to study their biographies, we should
find them in ancient documents; a third method that
exacts neither a knowledge of their history, nor their
genealogy, consists simply in reflection; this process,
which should be within the reach of all, is seldom used.</p>

<p>As I am constrained to follow the development of the
Vedic religion at the commencement of what was neither
polytheism nor monotheism; I recur to the <a href="#p_chapter">last word of<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
the preceding chapter</a> in order to find its historical
antecedents.</p>

<p>History tells us that much in the same way as a wild
beast pursues its prey, this epithet of atheist is hurled
at men who in truth have little in common. “In the
eyes of his Athenian judges Socrates was an atheist; yet
he did not even deny the gods of Greece, but he reserved
to himself the right to believe in something higher and
more truly divine than Hephaistos and Aphrodite.”<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Spinoza was called an atheist by the Jews, his co-religionists,
because his conception of Jahveh or Jehovah
was wider than theirs. The early Christians were called
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">átheoi</i> by the Jews and Greeks because they believed not
as the Jews and Christians believed. Were the Hindoos
atheists when they said, “What is Indra? it is the sun,
the rain only.” Were they atheists when they ceased
to believe in their Devas, the brilliant objects, the stars,
the fields, the rivers, the eyes of man? If the history of
the word atheist had only taught us one thing, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i> that
those who think differently from ourselves do not deserve
the reproach of atheism, it would have extinguished the
fires of many an <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">auto da fé</i>.</p>

<p>But are there real atheists? Do those persons exist
who are convinced that the word God represents nothing?
There may be; if you have succeeded in convincing
human reason that there can be an act without a cause,
a boundary without a beyond, a finite without an infinite;
then you will have proved without doubt that there is no
God. “God is a <em>great</em> word,” said a German theologian,
lately deceased, whose honesty and piety have never been
questioned, “he who feels and understands that, will judge
more mildly and more justly of those who confess that
they dare not say that they believe in God.”<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>We ought never to call a man an atheist till we know<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
what kind of God it is that he has been brought up to
believe in, and what kind of God it is that he rejects, it
may be, from the best and highest motives. If we can
respect the childlike faith of a charcoal-burner, let us also
respect philosophical doubt; it may well indicate a
turning-point in the life of a man, in which he is perhaps
abandoning a belief of which he has seen the error, or is
perhaps seeking to replace the less worthy faith, however
dear it may be to him, by one more perfect, however its
novelty may distress him; without such “atheism” as
this our religion would long ago have only been a congealed
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>In the life of an individual, as in the life of a nation,
there comes a moment when opinion becomes modified;
the old theory of the world being fashioned by a workman
as a potter moulds his vessels of clay, has gradually disappeared.
These ideas were so repugnant to the enlightened
mind of Sakya-muni, the Hindoo Prince&mdash;universally
known as Buddha&mdash;that he considered it
irreverent to enquire how the world was made, and still
more audacious to attempt to answer the enquiry.</p>

<p>That which took the place of henotheism amongst the
Hindoos might aptly be termed adivism, a denial of the
old Devas. Such a denial, however, of what was once believed,
but could be honestly believed no longer, so far
from being the end of religion, is in reality its vital
principle.</p>

<p>Whilst about to deal with ideas which I know are true,
it is gratifying to expose at the same time certain false
opinions which have been put forth on the subject; it is
curious to note how to start with a false opinion brings
one to a wrong conclusion. Herodotus, Cæsar, and Quintus
Curtius, who have all written on popular religious beliefs,
relate that men adored the sun, the earth, the sky, fire,
and water; that they worshipped certain rivers, and
certain trees, and considered as gods all things that were<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
useful to them. This was the opinion of the ancient
writers who knew no better, and modern theorists repeated
also: “Primitive men deified the grand natural phenomena
of nature, especially the stars, taking them for gods.”</p>

<p>It is not a matter for surprise that primitive man
should have formed the opinion that either in the world
or out of it there should be a sovereign power which they
considered as their gods.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the theory of fetishism was
held to explain all the intuitions of primitive man;
although not pertinent to the subject, this was not perceived
until afterwards, and the theory was considered
reasonable.</p>

<p>Whilst the <em>Theorists</em> take the predicate of God, when
applied even to a fetish, as requiring no explanation, the
<em>Historical School</em> sees in it the result of a long continued
evolution of thought. It was evident that the human
soul was so constituted that it must tend naturally and
inevitably towards the Unknown; it was also necessary
that man should learn that he possessed a soul.</p>

<p>We recognise that we have one; but are we equally
clear as to what it is?</p>

<p>We answer perhaps: “Yes, it is that part of us which
is not the body which perishes&mdash;the soul is immortal.”
It is well to be able to make such a reply, since it is true;
our catechisms have sown the seed of which this is the
result.</p>

<p>But since all human knowledge, whether abstract or
practical, has the same beginning, through the senses, and
that neither eye, ear, nor hand has to do with the soul,
what can we know of it? Above all, what can we learn
of its existence after death, the time when immortality has
passed beyond the sphere of the experience of the senses?
As man we recognise the spirit inhabiting the body, but
with no form, such as it might receive after death; we
can hardly clothe these ideas in words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>This belief in a soul, exactly like the belief in gods, and
at last in One God, can only be understood as the outcome
of constantly renewed observations and long meditations;
the annals of language furnish material for this study,
those ancient words, which, meaning originally something
quite tangible and visible, came in time to mean that
which is invisible and infinite.</p>

<p>The last breath of a dying person gave the first conception
of the presence in man of a non-corporeal principle;
it was recognised that this perceptible breath, at the
moment of death, was an accident and transient. Language
marks clearly the difference between the act of breathing
or breath, and that which breathed, the invisible agent of
this act&mdash;the living soul, the spirit. This agent received
different names, in the different languages; the Greeks
named it Psyche, saying that it was the breath which, at
the hour of death, passed out through the bars of the
teeth; amongst the Hindoos it was called <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Atman</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima</i> amongst the Latins, two words which originally
were understood by those using them as meaning
something breathing. Cicero spoke of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima</i>, but he
refrained from defining it, and frankly avowed that he did
not know whether to call it breath or fire.</p>

<p>The word breath has been used figuratively to express
the Power governing the world.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> A poet in the Veda
when speaking of the Supreme Being says, “It breathed
without air.”</p>

<p>Although the word breath was most frequently used
to denote the principle of life, another expression was
employed at a much earlier period; in countries the most
remote from each other, the words, <em>the shadow of the
dead</em>, were used, in order to express the idea of something
intangible yet closely related to the body. The influence
of language on thought is so real and so much more
powerful than the testimony of our senses, that those who<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
named the soul a shadow, came at last to believe that
corpses threw no shadow because it had left them.</p>

<p>It was then considered that the soul was not a homogeneous
whole, but composed of parts of which some are
ephemeral, destined to disappear with the body; these
parts form what the Greek and Latin writers call the Ego,
and the Hindoos <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Aham</i>, what in French would be termed
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moi</i>&mdash;three words for one thing&mdash;an object of contingency,
since it depends on circumstances&mdash;on the body,
on age, and on sex.</p>

<p>All men have endeavoured to solve the riddle of human
life; but the Hindoos, who especially excelled in researches
dealing with the formation of words, that is to say, with
the birth or development of ideas, whilst penetrating
deeply into the mysteries of their soul, their Atman,
arrived at an abstraction of this Atman, entirely freed
from all earthly or physical particles, and this “vehicle of
an abstraction” they considered to be incapable of perishing,
since it had no connection with breath, it was the
pure self, “freed from the fetters and conditions of the
human Ego,” hidden in the <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Aham</i>; not contingent on
circumstances&mdash;the self-existent One.</p>

<p>This new conception demanded a new name; the word
Atman, which at first signified all the concomitant elements
of the soul&mdash;those which pass, equally with those that
remain&mdash;the Hindoos retained in their language, and it
was used to define the essence itself, the being with no
attributes, identical with the Being who vivified nature,
the Infinite that supported man’s own being, the Highest
Self. Socrates knew this same Self, but he called it
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Daimonion</i>, the indwelling God, whom the early Christians
called the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>From the Hindoo point of view this idea holds in itself
the solution of the world’s great enigma. The commandment
indicating the kernel of all philosophy, “Know thyself,”
was the Hindoo doctrine. Know thyself as the self,<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
or if we translate it into religious language, “Know that
we live and move and have our being in God” (Acts
xvii. 28).<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>In recognising the soul as that which is the <em>self</em>, we see
that this fact of existing is more wonderful than the acts
of breathing, feeling, thinking, living, since none of these
manifestations are possible but on the sole condition of
having proceeded from the Being&mdash;who <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>After having analysed the human soul, the Hindoos
followed it from phase to phase from the moment when
the breath which makes man a living being received its
first names. They thus traced its history through time,
and believed that they could follow it through eternity.</p>

<p>Years were employed in the elaboration of this history,
and we only find its completion in a work which is
posterior to the Vedic hymns, the Upanishads. The study
of the human soul is the central point in Hindoo philosophy,
and the Upanishads are the first psychological work
which has ever been made.</p>

<p>There are persons who doubt the existence of things,
of which others feel certain; but no one ever doubted the
existence of his own soul. Why did the theologians who
arranged the creeds not include the article, “I believe in
my soul.” It would not have found men incredulous.</p>

<p>Reflection enables us to admit that the soul without
God could possess no history, since neither the soul without
God, nor God without the soul, could constitute religion.
For this which is called religion, if under the
form only of a soaring towards an unknown but longed-for
Being, has always existed since there have been men on
the earth.</p>

<p>We often meet the recurring questions “Whence?”
“Why?” and the frequent “Because”; and now we are
told by a small number of thinkers that all the explanations
of speculative philosophy on the first impulses of the<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
human soul towards religion, are only worthless suppositions,
unless philosophers&mdash;as historians have done&mdash;have
recognised that there was a revelation at the beginning of
time in the true sense of the word; but opinions differ as
to “the true sense of the word.”</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to apply the expression “the
Word of God” to the sacred canon of Scripture, that we
are inapt at seeking for God’s Word elsewhere. But our
first fathers read and studied it before the Bible existed.</p>

<p>To reflective minds, primitive man presents a moving
spectacle, drawn towards the Unknown&mdash;the Unseen&mdash;they
abandoned themselves unresistingly to the current leading
them in certain directions.</p>

<p>I imagine that our Aryan ancestors would not have
fixed their attention with such tenacity on the objects in
nature which environed them, had the stars and heavenly
bodies been immovable. But the sun appearing on the
one side, traversing the sky and then disappearing on the
opposite side, made the remark of the Incas prince very
natural: “There is some power behind the sun causing it
to ascend and descend.” It did not occur to him that the
sun travelled in accordance with natural laws. Other
princes and poets, with their eyes fixed on the moving
objects of the firmament, would have made the same reflection
and sought the invisible cause.</p>

<p>If the world had been propelled by a moving power
within itself, creatures possessing reason would have been
vaguely conscious of it from the first. They would have
been like the plants which turn regularly and infallibly in
one direction, since they are not free to do otherwise.</p>

<p>“You premise a revelation,” may be said to me, “and
yet you direct us towards Evolution; choose one of the
two since the one contradicts the other.”</p>

<p>That remains to be proved. Apply the theory of the
evolutionist to the mollusc; we see it directing itself, and
extending its tentacles, towards a crumb of bread that<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
floats on the water. If they touch it the contact calls
forth in the mollusc the act of seizing its prey. This is
only a movement of semi-consciousness, or perhaps rather
it is not entirely involuntary. Under the aspect of immediate
cause and effect, we see a principle anterior to
the phenomenon; certain perceptions which appear in the
sight of many psychologists to be innate, that is to say,
impressions received on our mind before we became conscious
of ourself, may well be the result of the receptability
of our Ego, which enables us, when it is affected in
a certain fashion, to represent these affections to ourselves
under certain forms.</p>

<p>The presentiment that unknown powers were to be
found behind the visible world only showed itself when
the Aryans first named them sky, sun, moon, storm, day,
night, all terms previously used for various parts of nature.</p>

<p>With the perception of a Beyond, with the desire to
know what it contained, a gap made itself felt which
separated it from the known world. It must be crossed&mdash;a
bridge was necessary. This thought spread from one
end of the globe to the other, but our ancestors were
the first bridge-makers. Scandinavian mythology mentions
a bridge built by the gods which was of three
colours; it was clearly intended originally for the rainbow.
The Milky Way provided the Hindoos with a bridge; and
in the Upanishads mention is made of a path having five
colours. Here we have the rainbow again probably. The
source of these legends is the ineradicable belief in the
heart of man, that the here and hereafter, the immortal
and the mortal, the divine and the human, cannot remain
apart for ever.</p>

<p>Here I will comment on a striking feature of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>.
The rishis give accounts of the manner in which
the hymns are composed. They say that they worked at
them as other workmen do, such as carpenters, weavers,
and potters. Sometimes they speak of the verses as<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
coming direct from the heart; another says his hymn
moves as a skiff on the river. Sometimes they speak of
their hymns as god-given, and that the gods themselves
are seers and poets. In no part of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> are
there traces of the theories of the verbal inspiration with
the meaning which the Greeks attached to the word as
a theophany or manifestation of divinity, nor as it was
understood afterwards in all religions, beginning with
Brahmanism.</p>

<p>It would be useless to seek for a complete exposition of
Vedic thought in the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>; all the hymns found in
it are not ancient; the collection was made by the priests,
and if they retained much that was useless for our purpose
in their worship, yet we should be very grateful to them,
as in this manner much has been preserved to us of the
ancient poetry of India, and it is they who recount the
pilgrimage undertaken by the Aryans in search of the
invisible lodestone which attracted them beyond what they
could see and hear. As they advanced they rejoiced, seeming
to attain their desire; but cast down under the weight of
their sadness, as at times they found themselves misled.</p>

<p>It is said in the Bible, that for God a thousand years is
as one day, and as I read the sacred books of India, not
as a learned critic, but as a man who is rejoiced to discover
his own thoughts in the writings of the Hindoo poets, the
three or four thousand years appear to me as one day
during which these poets have not ceased to pour themselves
out in their hymns, and it would be possible to
condense in one page the sentiments expressed in the first
hymns and the last Upanishads.</p>

<p>“Simple minded, not comprehending in my mind, I ask
for the hidden places of the gods.”<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> “My ears vanish,
my eyes vanish, and the light also which dwells in my
heart; my mind with its far-off longings leaves me; what
shall I say, and what shall I think?”<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>“There is no likeness of Him whose name is Great
Glory. He is not apprehended of the eye, nor by the
other senses, nor by speech; not by penance, or good
works. We do not know, we do not understand, how
anyone can teach it. It is different from the known, it
is also above the unknown, thus we have heard from those
of old who taught us this.”</p>

<p>“You will not find Him who has created these things;
something else stands between you and Him.”<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>These detached sentences acquire a very special value,
when it is remembered that they are not quotations drawn
from some modern works, which imitate the writings of
another epoch; these exist nowhere but in the <cite>Veda</cite>,
a literary work composed in the silence and shade, by
writers who themselves were ignorant of the object of
their desire.</p>

<p>One point at last becomes clear in the mist; a thousand
years probably before the coming of Christ in Palestine,
this verse was pronounced in the north of India, “He who
is above the gods alone is God.”<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The Grecian, Roman, and German divinities disappeared
before other beliefs; but the Hindoos who knew that their
gods were nothing more than mere names, had no dawning
religion within their reach that they could adopt; therefore
they did not abandon their traditions, and they continued
to grope, as one of their own poets says, “Enveloped
in mist and with faltering voices.”</p>

<p>All the religious thought of the Vedic period can be
found in the Upanishads (the literal meaning of this name
is, sessions or assemblies of pupils round their master).
There is not what could be called a philosophical system
in these Upanishads; they are fragments, and are in the
true sense of the word, guesses at truth; the spirit of
the work is liberal, all shades of opinion are represented in
it, the most divers, and sometimes contradictory. Conjectures<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
abound with regard to the creation, all start from
the theory that the world we see is not the true world,
and that before it appeared there was the true Self&mdash;the
Self-existent&mdash;the One which underlies the whole world,
from which has come all that seems to exist and does
actually exist. This was the final solution of the search
after the Unknown, the Invisible, which had been foretold
through a long chain of centuries; an intuition more
convincing than all the arguments which were used at
a later period to prove the existence of the Causa
Causæ.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the Brahmans in making a complete
collection of these vague presentiments, confused thoughts,
and true intuitions, were increased a hundredfold by the
fact that they had to accept every word and every sentence
of the Upanishads as supernaturally revealed. However
contradictory at first sight, all that was said in the
Upanishads had to be accepted and explained. It would
seem difficult to construct a well-arranged literary monument
out of such heterogeneous materials; but it was
harmonised and welded into a system of philosophy that
for solidity and unity will bear comparison with any other
system of philosophy in the world.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>This gigantic work, which commenced with the Vedic
hymns and ended in the book called the Vedanta, or End,
and was the end or supreme object of the Veda, is also
known under the name of Mîmâmsâ-sutras. Mîmâmsâ is
a desiderative form of the root <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">man</i>, to think, and a very
appropriate name for a philosophical work of this kind;
and sûtra means literally a string; but it is here used
as the name of short and abstract aphorisms, rendered still
more enigmatical by the conciseness of the language.
There are several hundreds of these sayings or headings,
forming tables of contents, a magic chaplet of immeasurable
length, each word containing condensed thought.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
This work must have required a concentration of mind
which it is difficult for us to realise.</p>

<p>The meaning and form of these aphorisms are characteristic&mdash;here
is one.</p>

<p>“I will declare in a line, that which has required millions
of volumes.</p>

<p>“Brahma is true, the world is false; the soul is Brahma
and nothing else.”</p>

<p>Those who consider the Supreme Being as the Infinite in
nature, and the individual soul as the Infinite in man, must
consider God and the soul as one, not two, seeing there
cannot be two Infinites; such is the belief of the Hindoos;
but this belief does not belong to them exclusively, it
existed amongst the Greeks, and it is encountered in other
places in our day besides India.</p>

<p>As works of art these sûtras are of course nothing, but
for giving a complete and accurate outline of a whole
system of philosophy they are admirable. Under these
fragmentary forms can be found treatises of grammar,
etymology, exegesis, phonetics, ceremonial, and jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The aphorism which I have quoted is the pure
quintessence of the Vedanta.</p>

<p>And of Pantheism also, it may be said. This word
Pantheism is one of the most difficult to define, and
I shall not attempt to explain it. I have a horror of
epithets, and I am sorry that it is not always possible
to avoid them. I do not examine philosophical systems
too minutely, lest I should be drawn into hurling at them
such words as pantheism, mysticism, positivism, materialism,
naturalism, without being quite clear when it is no longer
lawful to express myself in these terms; epithets and labels
are very apt to return home to roost. I will therefore
confine myself to this remark, with regard to the belief
of the Hindoos; if each definite colour can be broken up
into a number of tints too numerous to name, may it not<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
be the same with certain shades and meanings in words
and thoughts?</p>

<p>The Greeks hardly suspected the existence of the Veda;
in more modern times Europe caught glimpses of it; and
now, although completely discovered and studied, it is
thoroughly known only to a few erudite scholars, which
explains the fact that this ancient creation of the Hindoo
mind has exercised so small an influence on our philosophy.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_228"><span class="smcap">The Sacred Writings of the Hebrews</span></h3>

<p>Whilst the hymns of the Rig-Veda, with their simple
meditations, invocations and interrogations&mdash;sent out by
chance, as it were, into space&mdash;accurately trace the march
of thought which accompanies the search for indications
of the Unknown&mdash;the Infinite; we look in vain in the
Old Testament for the first dawnings, the first impressions
made on the human soul by the existence of things divine.
From the time when, in the garden of Eden, Adam and
Eve entered into communion with the Eternal, the sacred
narrative of facts, evidently historical, continues in such a
manner as to have led some to regard it as merely
allegorical.</p>

<p>To verify in the light of scientific knowledge the titles
which the Bible can truly present to the veneration of the
Christian world appears to some more and more advisable.<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Few persons amongst the critical students of the Old
Testament doubt that the books said to be by Moses are a
collection of ancient documents, a compilation made by
different individuals living at different periods, with long
intervals between them, each with his own point of view.
The conscientious examination to which these portions of
the sacred writings have been subjected was directed at
first to isolated points, and in order to exercise freely the
critical faculties so much in evidence now, it was necessary<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
to modify the generally accepted view that the religion of
the Jews was cast in one piece, and perfect at the first.
It was necessary to separate the ancient documents from
those of a more recent date, but the attempt to make an
exact chronological table of the earlier history of the
Hebrews was abandoned. Until the death of Solomon
only round numbers could be used, even the date of the
oldest fact in history, the exodus of the Jewish people from
Egypt, cannot definitely be fixed. Amongst the Egyptologists,
whose testimony is of the greatest value, there is
great hesitation in assigning a date, though the greater
number hold to the fifteenth century B.C. Their representations
with regard to Moses are so devoid of definite
historical data as to envelop his personality in great
mystery.</p>

<p>The idea of a revelation expressly delivered to the
Jewish people acquired a more definite form in the Middle
Ages; and from the Reformation the theory was promulgated,
amongst those to whom the idea was not
repugnant, that to a small portion of humanity only&mdash;the
elect&mdash;had been consigned the task of disseminating the
knowledge of religious truth in the world. The study of
the Scriptures spread to all classes where it was not
forbidden to the laity, and from that time millions of
human beings knew no other literature.</p>

<p>Assured that the Old Testament contained the inspired
words, Jews and Christians alike read it with feelings of
reverence which naturally excluded all idea of captious
criticism. But the spirit of biblical criticism which
animated the reformers was never afterwards extinguished,
and attentive readers discovered variations in the construction
of the Pentateuch which at that time were
inexplicable. The fact that the Bible contained many
narratives which could not always be reconciled the one
with the other was known long before the period of which
we are speaking. St Jerome, when feeling the want of<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
more accurate Greek and Latin translations than those in
use in his time, undertook to make one, and wrote thus to
a friend of his, a priest: “Re-read the books of the Old
and New Testaments, and you will find so many contradictions
in the numbers referring to the years, and to the
kings of Judah and Israel, that it would require a man of
leisure rather than a student to enter thoroughly into the
matter.”<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Side by side with this historical reconstruction which is
now carried on, there is a work of examination being
pursued. It is asked by what means did the Jewish
people become so strong, so compact, whilst in the midst
of strange nations, and in spite of all vicissitudes. It is
also asked what was the earliest history of the Hebrews,
and whether it is due to the supernatural element that the
tribes assembled at the base of Mount Sinai were enabled
to become an united people; and, finally, these keen
questioners desire to know the stages by which the conception
of the Deity entered the Semitic mind.</p>

<p>The scholars who give themselves to these enquiries,
generally eliminate the question of popular orthodoxy from
the subject, since they consider that when theoretical
theology finds its way amongst such workers it does not
assist research; it confuses their point of view; they look
upon the whole race as becoming prophets, and the
prophets become apostles, and thus, out of proportion.
The work advances slowly; each critic puts forth his own
special lucubrations concerning the biblical settings which<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
all are naturally anxious to retain; contentions are rife on
the subject of the Hebrew writers; their lack of Christianity,
and their philosophy are both made matters for discussion,
and disputes between the commentators did not
cease.</p>

<p>Amongst those who are passive witnesses of the scientific
investigations, there are many who, without closely following
this modern exegesis, are sufficiently enlightened to
recognise its aim and its use, and they exclaim with a
satisfaction mixed with astonishment, “Whatever may be
said one fact remains certain, our holy Scriptures speak of
God as God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, as He most
truly is, therefore the Old Testament, the product of the
Semitic mind, is free from the taint which is perceptible
in ancient Aryan literature, that of mythology.”</p>

<p>Let us seek the reason of this immunity accorded to the
sacred books of the Hebrews, let us seek it <em>in</em> the language,
not <em>apart</em> from it, as some do when looking for the origin
of thought.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_231"><span class="smcap">The Various Names of God</span></h3>

<p>According to the historians who have made a study of
the ancient religions, each name given to or descriptive of
a deity corresponded to a special conception formed by the
people. This has been a generally received principle, and
it serves as a clue to guide us in our study of primitive
creeds.</p>

<p>The Semitic languages, like the Aryan, possessed a
number of names of the Deity in common, all expressive
of certain general qualities of the Deity, but all raised by
one or other of the Semitic tribes to be the names of
God, or of that idea which the first breath, the first sight
of the world, the feeling of absolute dependence on a power
beyond ourselves, had for ever impressed and implanted in
the human mind. These names were all either honorific<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
titles, or represented some moral qualities. El and El-Schadai&mdash;Strong,
Powerful; Bel or Baal&mdash;Lord; Adon or
Adonai&mdash;my Lord, Master; Melk or Moloch&mdash;King;
Eliun&mdash;the Highest God. Such names as these, so clear
and easily understood, did not readily lend themselves to
mythological contagion, and they were adopted by Christian
phraseology because they contained nothing but what
might be rightly ascribed to God.</p>

<p>I could have wished to pass over the name Eloha, which
eventually became Elohim, in silence, as its history is a
long one, but I shall say a few words about it, as it is one
of the most primitive names, and indicates to us what the
Semites understood by divine. The name Elohim, applied
to an unknown, invisible power, one not grasped by the
senses, was the expression of all that was superior and
beyond what was seen and known on the earth. At the
same time the name was used not exclusively for the
Deity, but for others whose attributes, whether physical or
moral, demanded a superlative appellative ... there were
thus several Elohims of varying natures, the Semitic
termination in <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">im</i> turning Eloha into a plural, still always
took a singular verb after it, and Elohim or the Elohim
(pl.) were both used.</p>

<p>If a comparison be made between the Semitic and
Aryan methods of treating the same subjects, the assertion
seems amply justified that mythology has not ventured
to effect an entrance into the thoughts of the
Hebrew writers. If the subject Dawn be taken, it would
remain with the Semitic authors a natural daily occurrence,
but the Aryan writers would transform it into a
personal agent taking the form of gracious, kindly
mythical personages. An example presents itself in the
book of Job.</p>

<p>Jehovah, the Creator of the universe, “answered Job
out of the whirlwind,” who had sought to learn the secrets
of nature. Jehovah said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hast thou commanded the morning since
thy days began, and caused the dayspring to
know its place?</p>

<p>“Declare if thou knowest it all.</p>

<p>“Where is the way to the dwelling of
light; and as for darkness, where is the place
thereof?</p>

<p>“Doubtless thou knowest, for thou wast then
born. And the number of thy days is great.”
(Job xxxviii. 12, 18, 19, 21).</p></div>

<p>This is dawn in biblical language and in nature; but
who would recognise it under the figure of Daphne, Eos,
or Ahana? All of whom have so exercised the brains of
our mythologists.</p>

<p>But Jehovah drives still more deeply the point of His
discourse into the conscience of Job.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Who hath cleft a channel for the water
flood, to cause it to rain on a land where no
man is?</p>

<p>“Hath the rain a father?</p>

<p>“Or who hath begotten the drops of
dew?</p>

<p>“Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
that abundance of waters may cover thee?”
(Job xxxviii. 25, 26, 28, 34).</p></div>

<p>The Aryans had also described the rain, and their
thoughts on the subject coincided with those of the
Semitic race, but they were clothed in the grotesque
language generally associated with myths.</p>

<p>“The rain is represented in all the primitive mythologies
of the Aryan race as the fruit of the embraces of
Heaven and Earth.”<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> This is an advance towards the
poetical metaphor which Æschylus at a later date thus
expressed: “The bright sky loves to fructify the earth;
the earth on her part aspires to the heavenly marriage.<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
Rain falling from the loving sky impregnates the earth,
and she produces for mortals her fruit.”</p>

<p>It is necessary to possess a somewhat profound knowledge
of the morphological characteristics of the Semitic
and Aryan languages in order to note accurately the
particulars to which I have drawn attention, and to understand
the amount of influence they exercise on religious
phraseology.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_234"><span class="smcap">The Genius of Languages</span></h3>

<p>Each linguistic family has special features, just as each
race has its own physiognomy; the distinctive feature of
the Semitic languages is that the significative elements
destined to form appellatives, when once incorporated as
roots in the body of a word, suffered no modification, and
the original meaning could never be ignored. Thus all
Semitic names for the dawn, the sun, the vault of heaven,
the rain, and other natural phenomena, preserving their
appellative character, could not be used for any other
object; thus they could never express an abstract idea,
such as that of the Deity. The method followed with
regard to the arrangement of words in the greater number
of Semitic dictionaries, which are generally arranged
according to their roots, attest the truth of this fact.
When we wish to find the meaning of a word in Hebrew
or Arabic, we first seek for its root, and then look in the
dictionary for that root and its derivatives. In similar
languages no ambiguity is possible; nothing lends itself
to myths.</p>

<p>In the Aryan languages, on the contrary, such an
arrangement would have been extremely inconvenient;
here the roots were apt to become so completely absorbed
by the derivative elements, whether prefixes or suffixes,
that often substantives ceased almost immediately to be
appellative, and were changed into mere names or proper<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
names; this peculiarity of the language enabled the
Hindoos to form such words as Dyaus, Aditi, Varuna,
Indra, which at first designate various aspects of nature,
and afterwards were applied to different aspects of divinities.
The preceding pages have afforded us many examples,
and I hope that the comparison I have drawn
between the two representations of the same object will
suffice to explain why it is that we possess a Grecian and
Hindoo mythology, but that there was no Hebrew
mythology.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_235"><span class="smcap">Metaphor</span></h3>

<p>But, on the other hand, the Old Testament is full of
metaphor&mdash;these pearls of discourse; these expressions so
light and effective in the mouths of poets as they skim
over the surface of the subject in hand, but which we
make so ponderous and ungraceful with our literal interpretations.
When David speaks of God as a rock, a
fortress, a buckler, we have no difficulty in understanding
his meaning, although we might express ourselves differently,
and probably speak of the ever-present help of
God. Where we allude to a temptation from within or
from without, it was more natural for the ancients to
speak of a tempter, whether in a human or animal form.
What with us is a heavenly message or a godsend was to
them a winged messenger.</p>

<p>What is really meant is perhaps the same, and the
fault is ours, not theirs, if we persist in understanding
their words in their outward and material aspect only;
and forget that before language had sanctioned a distinction
between the concrete and the abstract, the intention
of the speakers comprehended both the concrete and
the abstract, both the material and the spiritual, in a
manner which has become quite strange to us.<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> I<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
believe it can be proved that more than half the difficulties
in the history of religion owe their origin to this constant
misinterpretation of ancient language by modern language,
of ancient thought by modern thought, particularly whenever
the word has become more sacred than the spirit.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_236"><span class="smcap">The Later Name for God amongst the Hebrews</span></h3>

<p>Each divine name mentioned hitherto represented a
quality or an attribute; we now come to one of comparatively
more recent date, which contains neither attribute
nor similitude; it is mentioned for the first time in a
conversation between God and Moses. God speaks from
the burning bush, and tells Moses to bring the children of
Israel out of Egypt. “And Moses said unto God:
Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel and shall
say unto them: ‘The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you’; and they shall say to me: ‘What is His
name?’ what shall I say unto them? And God said
unto Moses: ‘I Am that I Am.’ And he said: ‘Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent
me unto you’” (Exod. iii. 14, 15).</p>

<p>God in speaking of Himself said: “I Am that I Am,”
or, “I Am”; but man in designating God used the word
Jehovah. The etymology of this word was sought, and it
was regarded by many, rightly or wrongly, as a derivative
of the verb to be. Jehovah was thus&mdash;absolute existence,
or the Being.</p>

<p>“And God spake unto Moses and said unto him: ‘I
am Jehovah; and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac,
and unto Jacob as El Shaddai, but by my name Jehovah
I was not known to them’” (Exodus vi. 2, 3).</p>

<p>Writers are now generally agreed that Jehovah should
be pronounced Jahveh. Renan notices this striking fact.
“The name of God which has conquered the world,” he<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
says, “is unknown to all who are not Hebraists, and even
they do not know how to pronounce it.”</p>

<p>By a superstition which some writers trace back to a
very remote period, the Israelites considered the name
which God had used of Himself to be too sacred to be
uttered by human lips; gradually its use was discontinued;
and the name Lord was used in its place.</p>

<p>Although the names of God all indicated the one true
God, they did not preserve the children of Israel from
polytheism, since there was hardly a tribe that did not
forget the original meaning of the titles used. If the Jews
had remembered the meaning of the word El, they could
not have worshipped Baal as distinct from El; but in the
same way as the Greeks connected the worship of Apollos
and Uranus with that of Zeus, so the Jews were ready at
times to invoke the gods of their neighbours.</p>

<p>It is not that the earlier names of the Deity contained
no second meaning as qualificative adjective; Force, for
instance, could be symbolised, but the idea of absolute
existence expressed by the words, “I Am,” excluded all
symbol and all likenesses.</p>

<p>The Jews did not profit by this preservative from error;
on the contrary, with the advent in Israel of this new conception
of the Deity, the partial eclipse which so often
obscured their reason seems at times to have given place
to one more complete. As soon as Moses had constituted
them a nation, they appear to have looked upon God as a
national God, ignoring His relationship with other peoples.</p>

<p>The salient point in the Old Testament is the relation
of God with His people, an alliance or covenant between
Jehovah and Israel of which the rainbow became the first
type. Threatenings and promises enforced the keeping of the
moral law, the good and evil things of this life; if Israel
obeyed the Lord and kept His commandments, the fields
would yield their crops, the trees their fruits, and peace
would reign in the land; if they were disobedient, the<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
heaven would become brass, and famine and pestilence
would decimate the people, and the rest would be led
captive by foreign kings.</p>

<p>Although no definite assertion concerning the immortality
of the soul may be found in the Old Testament, a belief
in personal immortality is taken for granted in several
passages, and mention is frequently made of an abode in
which the spirits remain after their separation from the
body, that is Sheol, in which joy and suffering are equally
unknown. The picture drawn by David in some of the
Psalms, of the abode of the departed is sad and desolate.
Though the word is not meant for an individual grave,
this idea may have been borrowed from it; the meaning
is that of a vast space in the interior of the earth; the
dead lie down and are together and at rest, but separated
not only from man but also from God.</p>

<p>The Hebrews naturally mourned and compassionated
their dead most sincerely. “Alas my father, alas my
mother, my poor children.” But why should we Aryans,
whose language is not allied philologically with the Semitic,
copy their phrases? Why should we Christians, who are
not linked to them by dogma, allow ourselves to use
the same hopeless expressions, instead of words instinct
with life and hope?</p>


<h3 id="Ref_238"><span class="smcap">On the Prophets</span> (<span class="smcap">Nābhī</span>)</h3>

<p>The phenomenon of prophecy, one of the earlier
developments of the human mind, has been found amongst
all peoples, at one time or other of their history. Certain
spontaneous psychical movements dominated men. The
important rôle played by the oracles in the history of
Greece, is well known; the Greeks classed both the priests
who interpreted the auguries, and those persons who
considered themselves inspired by the gods and claimed a<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
knowledge of hidden things, under the name of prophets,
indifferently. In the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the Jews of
Alexandria, when writing the Septuagint, translated the
Hebrew word <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">Nābhī</i> by prophet. As amongst Hebraists
the word Nābhī does not necessarily imply the power of
foretelling the future, whilst the word prophet conveys
that meaning, it might have been well to employ both
terms.</p>

<p>The original meaning of the word Nābhī seems to have
been “agitated outbursts.” These men seem to have
passed through a phase of nervous exaltation before
beginning their exhortations; when once they had started
their outpourings they no longer had control over their
spirit’s impulse; and were often physically prostrated,
showing signs of an overpowering compelling physical
force, divinely irresistible.</p>

<p>These Nābhīs, who appeared on the occasion of any
crisis, when the welfare of the public was at stake, were
at the head of popular movements, giving them a right
direction; they were the first to rise against the oppression
of the ruling powers, and thousands of them perished in
misery. Isaiah likens them to sentinels, or watchmen
always on the alert, watching with eyes fixed on the
horizon, charged with the duty of sounding the alarm on
the approach of danger. “One calleth unto me out of
Seir; Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what
of the night?” This same Isaiah compares the negligent
prophets to “dumb dogs, that cannot bark, lying down,
loving to slumber.”</p>

<p>Their preaching must have been very powerful; Luther,
in speaking of the prophecies of Isaiah, says, “Every
word is a furnace.”</p>

<p>Until now Jehovah had by the mouth of the Nābhīs
addressed the people as a nation; the individual was not
singled out. But imperceptibly a change took place; new
indications presented themselves. Instead of the order,<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
“Slay, slay,” milder accents were heard; it was as though
heart spoke to heart: “Wherewith shall I come before
the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I
come before Him with burnt offerings; with calves of a
year old? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath
showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy”
(Micah vi.).</p>

<p>The individual becomes more evident; like the rishis,
Elijah sought the Lord; and he came to Mount Horeb:
“And a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and
brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord
was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake;
but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the
earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire;
and after the fire a still small voice,” I imagine that
Elijah said to himself: “That still small voice is for <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>There were in certain places assemblies of Nābhīs, and
schools in which the young prophets were trained in
rhetoric and in composing discourses; for though some
improvised, others&mdash;amongst them probably Isaiah&mdash;previously
wrote their messages. All used a rhythmical
language akin to poetry; the teaching of music no doubt
formed a part of their education, since we know that the
sound of music helped to produce the ecstasy which resulted
in prophesy.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The gift seems to have been to some
extent contagious. Prophets were found in bands, prophesying,
and followed by musicians.</p>

<p>During the eight centuries preceding our era, a succession
of terrible calamities took place. The Nābhīs upheld the
courage of the people by their immovable conviction that
the Lord would send a leader, and deliverer of the people
from their enemies. Through the whole of this time
Israel, though often despairing and sometimes in revolt,<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
resisted doubt; an unknown phenomenon amongst the
heathens of antiquity. That which strikes us as so inexplicable
is that Judaism showed itself capable of such
prodigies of devotion and self-sacrifice, though so little
sustained by the bright glimpses of the future life.</p>

<p>The Elohim with whom the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob were permitted to hold intercourse, appeared
more accessible to the Israelites than the mighty Jehovah
of whom they were forbidden to make an image. The
more we contemplate the infinite grandeur of the majesty
of God, of whom there is no similitude, whose name is “I
Am,” to whom, according to Fenelon, even the word spirit
is inapplicable, and of whom, according to Descartes and
Bossuet, nothing may be said but this, “The Being,” the
more it seems possible to fear, to reverence Him; but to
love in those days seemed difficult&mdash;love was rarely
seen.</p>

<p>I desired to know what the best and most profound
thinkers could say on the ties uniting them with their
Creator, those who had experienced the action of the
Divine love in themselves. At the same time I determined
to emphasise as little as possible the various forms
these thoughts might wear, whether in philosophical
systems or in religions which had been founded or organised
in the visible Church.</p>

<p>Amongst the thinkers who have occupied themselves
with these matters, I will mention one who, about two
hundred years ago, was looked upon as a dangerous heretic.
Since that time Baruch Spinoza has been anathematised as
an atheist, and venerated as a saint; afterwards he was
declared by certain philosophers to be no atheist, but
was counted as a Pantheist. In our day he is known
to be less of a Pantheist than was thought.</p>

<p>Shrinking from such epithets, which disturb my judgment,
I will not enter into the question as to which
approaches more nearly to the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>I spoke once after this manner to some friends of mine,
in the presence of one whom I had not seen before.</p>

<p>“You are too diffident,” he said to me, “I will give
you a safeguard against obscurity of judgment. Read any
system of philosophy you like, you will doubtless discover
that error predominates in it; put it aside for the time
being and read another, make the round of several systems.
With each your first impression will probably be renewed.
After that go over each in your mind, not in detail, but
taking each in its entirety. You will find that you can
point out a certain truth, <em>one</em> truth which will have
occurred in all. Let this gradually expand in your mind
without unduly forcing it; you will have forgotten the
epithets used, and will find one dominant note which will
enlighten your judgment.”</p>

<p>The manner in which Spinoza interpreted the sacred
writings of his race has perhaps not attracted sufficient
attention. His most important work from this point of
view has the somewhat repellant title of <cite>Tractatus theologico-politicus</cite>.
It is diffuse and heavy, and its translators
have not succeeded in rendering it more agreeable.
It is very difficult to grasp in detail, as omissions and
reservations abound.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_242"><span class="smcap">The Views of Spinoza</span></h3>

<p>When reading Spinoza it is necessary to bear in mind&mdash;which
is not easy&mdash;that he is neither a heathen philosopher
nor a Father of the Church nor a modern critic,
but a learned Jew, living in the middle of the seventeenth
century. I will try to reproduce his opinions in his own
words, and endeavour to keep them uncontaminated, as
far as possible, with the views of the end of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Spinoza asserts plainly that he receives the Bible as an
inspired book; in this he perhaps differs from some of our<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
more recent exegetes who examine the Bible as any other
literary work of history and morality.</p>

<p>Christians grow up in the truth that the Bible contains
the Word of God, and they claim that their teaching has
its basis in the Old Testament. But others have argued
thus: What do these know of the history of the Hebrews?
They do not understand the language of their writings,
and they cannot say what caused those sublime teachers
of the people, the prophets, to speak on such and such an
occasion, in such and such a manner. Being ignorant on
all these points it is possible that interpretations of the
Old Testament may have led us into error.</p>

<p>The existence of what are now called the laws of nature
being unknown in those far-off days, the Hebrews were
unable to recognise secondary or mediate causes; the
book of Job is an example of this. God intervenes personally
on each occasion. Our attention is directed solely
to two points: man who suffers, that is, who consents or is
in revolt, and God who wills or wills not.</p>

<p>As everything without exception is placed in direct relationship
with God in the Old Testament, all is said
to emanate from God; the cedars of Lebanon are the
cedars of God;<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> men of great stature, the giants, are
called in Genesis sons of God; the knowledge of nature
and of natural things which Solomon possessed is called
the wisdom of God; the discretion of a judge and the
gains of a merchant are the gifts of God; Assyria is the
scourge of God, and the lightning His arrows. And
Spinoza asks: why are the children of Israel called God’s
chosen people? Because the Lord, having delivered them
out of Pharaoh’s hands, led them into the land of Canaan,
where they lived under the laws revealed to Moses, to
which the surrounding nations were not subject. “I will
be your God, and ye shall be My people,” Jehovah had
said by the mouth of Moses. This was the covenant<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
concluded on Mount Sinai between the Lord God and the
Jewish nation. These laws, which were at the same time
civil and religious, were included under the general term,
the Law of the Lord, and the Book containing these precepts
was called the Word of God.</p>

<p>According to an ancient tradition, God revealed to
Noah seven precepts which corresponded to commandments
given generally to all mankind without distinction
of race; there was thus perhaps a revelation given at the
beginning of time, even before the first and greatest of
the prophets, Moses; and this revelation the patriarchs
knew. The light which lightens every man born into the
world impressed these first precepts on the human heart;
to the Jewish race it seemed perhaps improbable that a
divine law not promulgated by a human mouth nor delivered
in the name of the God of Israel, could be imposed
on man; as Moses was permitted to hear God’s voice
amongst the lightnings and thunders, the Israelites considered
themselves on a higher level than the rest of
humanity, and held in less esteem eternal verities which
were the possession of all mankind. Moses told them
that after his death God would raise up a prophet amongst
them on condition that they should keep His Covenant
and His Commandments to do them, and he warned
them of the consequences of breaking these: “I testify
against you this day that ye shall surely perish.”</p>

<p>We find the second revelation in the books ascribed to
Moses; written in our memory as distinctly as in the Bible;
it has so entirely eclipsed the first that the greater number
of us do not remember ever to have heard of the seven
precepts of Noah.</p>

<p>After the death of Moses, prophets succeeded each
other in Israel; all from the first to the last acknowledged
that they received the revelation either by symbols or
illustrations, or by the word; their eyes saw certain
objects and their ears heard the explanation of what they<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
saw. Ezekiel, like Moses, saw God under the appearance
of a flaming fire; Daniel saw Him as the “Ancient of
Days, whose garment was white as snow”; the disciples
of Christ saw the Spirit of God under the form of a dove;
the Apostles as tongues of fire; and Saul, at the moment
of his conversion, recognised it in a bright light, and
these visions were always accompanied by words.</p>

<p>The prophets rise above the level of other men by the
intensity of their faith, and by their vivid imagination;
but imagination is mobile, and their ecstatic conditions
were not permanent; how could they feel assured of
being in direct communication with the Lord Himself?
They were so lacking in assurance that they often required
some palpable sign, thus did Abraham, Moses, Gideon
and many others. Each time the sign was granted to
them; a fire descending from heaven to consume the
offering; a rod changed into a serpent; a healthy hand
instantly covered with leprosy; a fleece of wool remaining
dry on ground that was wet with dew, and other miraculous
signs.</p>

<p>According to Spinoza the gift of prophecy is on a
lower level than that of ordinary intellectual knowledge
which requires no outward sign of confirmation.</p>

<p>The nature of the revelation depended also upon the
temperament of each prophet, on his education and his
own personal opinions; the Magi who studied astronomy
and astrology, seeing a star in the east, at once went in
search of the expected child. But on one point all were
agreed, they all said with Moses: “Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy might, and thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.” And they said with Isaiah: “Wash you,
make you clean, put away the evil of your doings, cease
to do evil, learn to do well, relieve the oppressed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>


<h3 id="Ref_246"><span class="smcap">Obedience</span></h3>

<p>A striking feature of Spinoza’s philosophical system
was the basis of obedience upon which the whole edifice
of a religious life rested; now obedience presupposes the
existence of a law.</p>

<p>As the Israelites seemed incapable of appreciating the
intrinsic excellence of the precepts delivered to them,
Moses enforced their fulfilment, and spoke of God to
them as a just and righteous law-giver who would reward
those who kept the commandments and punish those
who transgressed them. And when this law was given
out, amongst thunders and lightnings, the children of
Israel acknowledged it with acclaim&mdash;though not always
fulfilling it&mdash;because they were the only people possessing
it.</p>

<p>At last the time came when it was possible to say:
“The appointed hour has come.” The Jewish nation, for
whose sake the Mosaic law had been revealed, was on the
point of crumbling to pieces, when Christ appeared proclaiming
the universal and divine law. Christ was no
prophet in the ordinary acceptation of the word, since
neither word nor vision revealed God’s Will to Him, the
truth was in Him in all its plenitude, His mind was
identical with that of the Father, and Eternal Wisdom
took the form of humanity.</p>

<p>Jewish as well as Christian theologians have equally
contributed at times to obscure the sense of the Holy
Scriptures; they have taught that man’s reason is unsound
and can with difficulty penetrate the mysteries of religion;
and that the only way, therefore, was to accept the Bible
as infallible in all its details. The faithful extended this
doctrine of infallibility to every verbal peculiarity and
failed to distinguish the eternal principles, always clearly
and simply expressed by the prophets, from those vivid
illustrations which enabled them to speak, without<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
hindrance, in terms most adapted for arousing the wonder
and belief of the ordinary hearer, of matters <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i> inexpressible,
as for instance of the Divine Nature. Spinoza
especially blames the theologians for having introduced in
their commentaries notions borrowed from Grecian philosophers,
which they adapted to the Old and New Testament,
clothing them in biblical language; this mixture
of divine inspiration and subtle argument more and more
disturbed pious souls who went to their Bibles for
edification only.</p>

<p>To those capable of understanding them Christ revealed
the secrets of the Kingdom of God; they were the
higher truths of eternal life, the counsels of perfection; to
the multitude He spoke in parables and gave them commandments
which were to be obeyed that they might
enter the kingdom of heaven. The Apostles spread
abroad the teachings of Christ; they preached the love of
God with that of our neighbour, not as sufficing in itself,
but as a commandment spoken in the name of the Life
and Passion of our Saviour. And then each one added
to these great truths minor teachings, varying the subjects
according as they addressed Jews or Gentiles; many
different teachings were thus promulgated, giving rise in
the early Church to misunderstandings, gradually leading
to disputes and schisms; and after nineteen centuries of
study of the subject we still have not arrived at perfect
mutual understanding. Spinoza quotes in this connection
a Dutch proverb: “Geen ketter; sonder letter.” Without
a text, no heresy.</p>

<p>When shall we learn that the revelation of God is not
confined to a certain number of books, to a certain number
of words? It must of necessity be inscribed elsewhere
also, since words are patient of more than one interpretation,
books go astray and are lost, paper becomes mildewed
and is torn, stones are smashed even in the hands of a
prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>Spinoza tells us that he read and re-read the Holy
Scriptures with the greatest care before commenting on
them, and he undertakes to demonstrate to the Christian
governments the necessity of reforming the constitutions of
the established churches by replacing a phantom Bible by
the Bible understood in spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>The scientific portion of the task would not be complicated,
since the commandments of God are few in
number, in fact they may be reduced to one. “He that
cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him”; and as a
proof that they seek Him they must practise justice and
charity; these are the foundations of the faith, and they
are so clear and so simple, that no commentary thereon
is needed, nor are they affected by any of the verbal
differences or inaccuracies.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical authorities thus act sometimes
contrary to the divine will when they declare those who
are leading a good and virtuous life to be the enemies of
God, simply because their opinions are not in exact
conformity with the theological definitions put forth by
the churches. The civil power ought to be able to judge
of the belief of its citizens by the fruits they produce, if
their works are good, it may be thought that in the eyes
of God their belief is also correct, but personal theological
opinions, though in conformity with the decrees permitted
by the Church, would not prevail in God’s sight over
wrong doing. When governments act in accordance with
these views, all is well&mdash;individuals, the nation, and the
governments.</p>

<p>In order to believe that God’s Word may be found
elsewhere, it is necessary to believe that He exists. His
existence cannot be known;<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> we can, however, obtain
some knowledge of it by certain means of which we can<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
know the reality; they are so real that we cannot imagine
any force that can invalidate them; these means or
notions are the fundamental axioms inherent in the human
mind, and are the bases of all knowledge; it is to these
that we owe the power of being able to distinguish good
from evil, and this faculty we may regard as the forerunner
of the divine revelation. If we once admit the
possibility of these first principles&mdash;these axioms&mdash;becoming
obliterated, we should then admit a doubt of their
intrinsic truth, which would attack and weaken their
immediate conclusion, which is the existence of God;
from that time we should possess no element of certainty.
This is why it has been said that attacks against reason
are more dangerous than attacks against the faith, because
they destroy with one blow the sacred edifice and the
foundation which bears it.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_249"><span class="smcap">The Law</span></h3>

<p>In a system where law is everything, how does Spinoza
understand the action of Providence?</p>

<p>Men are accustomed to call that knowledge divine
which surpasses the human understanding, and that event
miraculous when the cause is unknown to them; and
nothing better demonstrates to them the existence of God,
His power and His providence, than those things which
appear to them to change the order of nature. We sometimes
show our ignorance by attributing things of which
we are ignorant to a special interposition of providence.
Those who think thus are not in a position to explain what
they mean by the order of nature.</p>

<p>This manner of viewing things might well date from
the time of the early Hebrews, who wished to prove to
those nations who were not Semitic, and who worshipped
visible objects, such as the heavenly bodies, that these
were subordinate deities, subject to the will of the invisible<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
God, whose miracles on their behalf they related, since
they were convinced that the whole of nature contributed
to the well-being of the Hebrew people exclusively.</p>

<p>With God the understanding and the will are the same;
to know and to will is a single act; to know an object as
it is in itself, and to realise it effectively, is a necessity
inherent in the Divine perfection; since all truths come
inevitably from the Divine intellect, the universal laws of
nature are the eternal decrees of God.</p>

<p>If any event takes place in nature not in accordance
with these universal laws, then the mind of God has not
conceived it; in other words, he who affirms that in a
certain case God has acted contrarily to the laws of nature,
affirms also that God has acted contrarily to His own
Divine nature, which would prove the speaker’s perversity.
No event happens that is not by the will and eternal
decrees of God, each event conforms to laws eternally
necessary and absolutely true. To believe that this could
be otherwise would be to admit that God made an
imperfect nature, and established laws so incomplete that
they required to be retouched each time that they failed
to realise the divine plan, a strange conception, and for
which there is no necessity. Those who seek and find
their supreme happiness in the love of God, and in doing
the greatest good, have no wish that nature should obey
them; they desire to submit to nature, knowing indubitably,
that God governs all things in accordance with
general laws which are in agreement with universal life.</p>

<p>From this statement it will be seen that it is no longer
a question of resignation&mdash;of passive submission; man
responds in every part of his being to the supreme law
which, as is the case with all men, leads them blindly,
and, for the most part, unconsciously towards happiness;
and causes, in a great nature, such as Spinoza’s, an
unceasing effort to maintain and to raise itself; the
passage from excellence to perfection is always accompanied<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
by a feeling of joy, and sadness marks each backward step
towards imperfection. The being&mdash;Spinoza’s monad&mdash;thus
typifies perfection, and good, and evil consists in the
increase or diminution of the being. The natural love of
man for life has been transformed by Spinoza into law;
his maxim is well known: Every being tends to preserve
its existence.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_251"><span class="smcap">The Law in the Gospel</span></h3>

<p>The Old and New Testaments are an exposition of a
long discipline of obedience, this makes their power, and
those who study them without preconceived ideas discover
this.</p>

<p>Spinoza distinguishes between the spiritual needs of the
majority of men and the minority, and between the religions
which suit the one and the other. But all men, without
exception, must acquire the religion demanded by all, that
is practical religion, which consists in keeping those commandments
given us in the sacred books. This obedience
serves to weaken passions; in the same proportion as man
attains this end, so a light, ever increasing in purity,
illumines his intellect, and so much the more does he
comprehend that true happiness is the result of virtue.
Few men go beyond this, or&mdash;without any other guide
than their reason&mdash;experience that intellectual love of
God, inseparable from the true knowledge of God and
man; this love, when entirely disinterested, yields a joy
which is not the reward of virtue, since it is one with
virtue itself.</p>

<p>The divine law was in the world, as St John said, before
the coming of Moses or of Christ, but the world as a whole
was ignorant of it; reason leads us to it, and reason tells
us that it leads to the highest beatitude, and that those who
follow it will not need to seek any other.</p>

<p>But there is one thing of which reason cannot tell us;<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
this&mdash;that the moral effect of this universal law, which
is obeyed, not because it is true, necessary and perfect,
but simply because Moses commanded the observance of
it, by reason of the covenant made by God, and because
Christ commands it in His own name, is the power of
leading to this beatitude, which those obtain who strive
after the spirit of Christ, perceiving in this law of God,
absolute truth. This reason alone could not have taught
us, it is not written in the human heart, this we learn
in the Bible.</p>

<p>That obedience only to a truth should inevitably produce
certain results can hardly be asserted with mathematical
certainty, since mathematical results are the effects
only of those things which can be deduced from the
elements contained in them; but a moral certainty we
can feel, and this was the privilege and portion of the
prophets; and it was possible, as it was not contrary to
reason.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_252"><span class="smcap">Biographical Note</span></h3>

<p>Spinoza belonged to a family of Portuguese Jews settled
in Amsterdam. He led an exemplary life; he was poor
and apparently content to be so, since he refused help from
his friends, which he might have accepted with a clear
conscience; what he obtained by polishing spectacle lenses
seems to have satisfied him. He was advised to dedicate
one of his books to Louis XIV., a munificent patron of
literary men, but he did not do so.</p>

<p><cite>Ethics</cite>&mdash;the work to which he owes his fame&mdash;in
accordance with his express wish, only appeared after his
death, and without the name of the author, because, he
said, the truth should go forth under no man’s name; he
feared also to attach his to a new school of philosophy.</p>

<p>The Rabbis of Amsterdam had long sought to bring
Spinoza into a more orthodox path than the one he trod;<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
his idea that the institution of prophets had been a source
of weakness rather than of strength to the Hebrew people,
threatened to develop into a formal heresy.</p>

<p>The appearance in 1656 of Spinoza’s <cite>Tractatus theologico-politicus</cite>,
raised a storm of indignation; it was the
only work of importance which he published during his
lifetime; it was followed by a sentence of excommunication,
read at the gate of the synagogue, and was in these
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the name of the Angels and by a decree of the
Saints, we anathematise and exorcise Baruch Spinoza, in
the presence of the Sacred Books and the six hundred and
thirty precepts they contain. Cursed be he by day and
night; may the fury of the Lord consume this man, and
may all the maledictions written in the Book of the Law
light on him; may the Lord destroy him from amongst
the tribes of Israel; let no man go near him, nor speak to
him, nor write to him, nor show him any compassion.”</p>

<p>How eloquent men can be when they are angry!
Spinoza left his native town on that day; he took refuge
at the Hague, where he died in 1677, at forty-four
years of age.</p>

<p>In reading the pages in which eminent critics have
examined Spinoza’s system, one seems to see not the
man whose writings are known, but two different men,
or rather perhaps several different men; I do not think
even the philosopher would have recognised himself in these
résumés.</p>

<p>As has been noticed, Spinoza is neither a true Jew nor,
apparently, a Christian, since the negation of final causes
is as foreign to the spirit of the Old Testament, as his
joyous stoicism is to that of the New; some have remembered
the words of Novalis: “Spinoza is inebriated with
God.” They added that with him the crown of the
intellectual love of God was the transport of a soul
carried out of itself, but that this transport must have<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
differed from the ecstasies in which so many of the saints
of the Christian Church found the supreme delight of the
religious life. But amongst Christians what is their conception
of the highest beatitude? I see God in His
heaven, but my neighbour, where is he? On the one
side are the happy, on the other the faulty; we recognise
ourselves in each, we see ourselves, we have fellowship
with all; painters have so often represented this scene
on theological lines, that it is familiar to us; is this
really the beatitude we picture to ourselves?</p>

<p>The mental and moral condition of this philosopher
lends itself little to analysis; he who has the most carefully
studied his views, would be the most diffident in
expounding them, having found so many obscure points
in them. In any case it is well to remember this circumstance,
Spinoza has now been dead more than two hundred
years, and the discovery that before speaking it is advisable
to know something of the meaning of the words used, dates
from yesterday only. Spinoza in his <cite>Tractatus theologico-politicus</cite>,
uses constantly the words prophecy, inspiration,
revelation, faith, and theology, and the reader who has
sacrificed his rest for several nights that he may know
what he means by these five words, ends by acknowledging
that his devotion has been in vain. Happily, no one
knows better than our philosopher the meaning of the
word obedience; this helps the reader; he only regrets
that the critics have laid little stress on this crucial
point.</p>

<p>Since no man’s writings are capable of being clearly
understood if he is isolated from those who have written
on similar lines&mdash;beginning from Novalis (that poetic and
charming writer whose true name was Hardenberg), points
of comparison have been established between the Dutch
philosopher (Spinoza), the ecstatic Saint Theresa and the
enthusiastic Saint Francis d’Assisi. Let us now turn to the
more sober genius of Aristotle and see if he will<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
succeed in throwing daylight on the obscure thought of
Spinoza.</p>

<p>“Infinity attracts,” this word of Aristotle would have
sufficed, but the prince of critics gives a further explanation.
“Man is face to face with a truth, and the light
lighteth every one that cometh into the world; all who
see see the same things, and all that man has seen is
true.... God works in us not as a workman who tires
himself, but as an all-powerful virtue which acts; He moves
as an object of love.”<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>This opinion of Aristotle is shared by Plato, St Thomas
Aquinas and St Augustine. A complete unanimity.</p>

<p>When I am sometimes struck by certain truths, dressed
in all the brilliance which pure virtues possess, but feeling
unable to form a rational whole of these virtues when
they are not arranged in an orderly manner, I should
often have yielded to discouragement, if I had not read in
Bossuet’s <cite>Traité du libre arbitre</cite> these words: “When
we begin to reason, we must first consider this as indubitable,
that we may know <em>with complete certainty</em> many
things of which we do not understand their corollaries, nor
all their results. The first rule of our logic is that we
must not abandon truths which we have once known,
whatever difficulties may present themselves when we are
trying to deal with them; but that we must hold both
ends of the chain firmly, although we may not be able to
see the middle by which the two ends are linked.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_255"><span class="smcap">The Ideas of Plato</span></h3>

<p>A philosopher said to me: “Since we can know nothing
of the beyond, let us make a virtue of necessity, and learn
exactly what there is on our side of the veil.” The advice
is excellent. Astronomy teaches us that perfect order
reigns in the sphere studied by that science. The world<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
may be the result of certain chemical combinations which
have met by chance; but if chance has introduced order
in these chemical combinations, it might as easily derange
them and replace them by disorder; yet the astronomers
have not succeeded in discovering the least indication of
disorder in their domain; that we know positively.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the world has had a
beginning; is it reason or the absence of reason that we
should expect to find at the origin of the world? Does
it proceed so regularly in obedience to laws? Sages have
said, “Laws govern matter, forces, movements, all things
that <em>are</em>, but might not have been, just as the world is or
exists, but might not have been.”</p>

<p>Since Darwin wrote, much discussion has taken place
with regard to the origin of species, no one has thought of
asking whether the Greek philosophers had anything to
say on the subject. If, for instance, it had been discovered
that the law of certain sidereal phenomena compelled a
circular or elliptical movement, or any other geometrical
form, then this law, in itself, would be a geometrical idea;
that could exist, although the phenomenon in which it was
realised, might disappear with the world itself.</p>

<p>According to Kepler, geometry has given forms for all
creation, and Kepler has also said that God governs all
things in conformity with Himself; in that case geometry
would be anterior to the world and co-eternal with God,
and if these geometrical forms which are perfect have been
thought out by a perfect intelligence, is it not the same
with all the component parts of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms? Would a horse, or whatever the ancestor of a
horse may be, have been produced spontaneously by nature?
Must there not have been a type of some kind, which was
realised in all horses, multiplying and varying for every
new species? And in the same manner also for all trees
and plants. The first types of these things existed before
man, that other part of nature, and before all that man<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
calls the good, the beautiful. Were not all these things
thought and willed by a mind capable of thinking and
willing?</p>

<p>Thus Plato reasons.</p>

<p>It is received in theology as in philosophy that all
things have their ideal in God; matter itself has its conception
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> in God; St Thomas Aquinas
was able to say with no trace of pantheism, “God is
eminently all things.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_257"><span class="smcap">Episodial</span></h3>

<p>Two English travellers, Gatchet and Hall, finding
themselves once amongst the Klamaths, a tribe of Red
Indians, asked them concerning their beliefs; these Indians
worshipped a supreme being who made the world with its
plants, animals and men, whom they called “The most
Ancient,” “The Ancient One on high.” The travellers
then asked how He had created the world, whether by
means of tools or instruments; they replied, “By thinking
and willing.” This wonderful answer contains the
germ of the thought which, on Greek soil, became the
<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Logos</i>, the act of thinking and speaking, the unique act
which in the Creator means willing and producing. This
answer is an echo, and by no means a feeble one, of the
celebrated saying: “God is the Living One who is, in
whom is the Idea of Good” (Timaeus). Plato affirms
that the world and all that it contains has been made in
the eternal pattern of the Idea of Good, and this Idea of
Good is not separable from the Creator.</p>

<p>Again perfect unanimity, extending this time to the Red
Indians.</p>

<p>It might be thought that an electric current ran round
the world; certain psychical phenomena cannot otherwise
be explained.</p>

<h3 id="Ref_258"><span class="smcap">An Excursion into a Country little known</span></h3>

<p>If there are proofs of the existence of God, they should
be within reach of all the world, both the learned and the
ignorant, since God is no more the God of a certain class
of person than He is of a certain nation.</p>

<p>In some modern books on philosophy we see this phrase,
“The influence of the Infinite on souls,” though we may
not pay much attention to it, we perhaps have the feeling
that the infinite does not exercise much influence on us;
but it does not allude to ourselves, it refers to our primitive
ancestors, who sought to discover what there could be
behind all they saw and heard; common sense, with its
uncertain but powerful instincts directed primitive man
towards an invisible magnet. This is not our common
sense, that is, not as we should define it, self-evident
principles, spontaneous judgments, which direct our acts;
but common sense as Aristotle would understand the
word; the faculty of feeling and perceiving, where all our
sensations are united, because all our external senses converge
thither; this common sense is so truly a sense, that
it has its own central organ, which is what we call heart.
But this influence of the invisible&mdash;another name for the
infinite&mdash;had at first no connection with religion; it
merely deposited a germ in the soul, without which no
religious tendency could make itself felt; and under the
impulse of this power&mdash;this divine sense which Aristotle
calls the attraction of the desirable and the intelligible&mdash;the
passing from the finite to the infinite&mdash;the most
natural and the most necessary act of the moral life&mdash;is
accomplished by a simple flight or upward movement of
the human spirit.</p>

<p>Plato explains this mental phenomenon: “There is in
the depth of our soul a point which is the root of the soul
and which forms a connecting link between God and the
soul; the soul apprehends because God has touched it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>Perceiving in itself and all around it traces of goodness,
beauty, justice, love, and joy; feeling in itself and around it,
life and its forces; it is only necessary for the soul to send
its ideas beyond the limits of its own confined being, with
its imperfect capabilities and joys, and it will approach
God.</p>

<p>Kepler, when discovering the laws governing the planetary
system, found geometry in the sky; since then, the
learned have found mathematics in all the branches of
physics. They have seen numbers and geometrical figures
in light and colour, in sound and in music under its
sensible form. Leibnitz, one of the world’s greatest
mathematicians, who discovered the infinitesimal calculus,
saw that in this way one could pass from finite grandeur
to mathematical laws and forms such as belong eternally
to God&mdash;independent of all dimensions.</p>

<p>Between the spontaneous flight of the soul with spreading
wings, going from finite facts to infinite, and the
highest mathematics, which have existed for about two
hundred years only, the analogy is complete; the learned
demonstrations of the existence of God given by all true
philosophers are results which correspond with those
obtained by the ordinary methods used by all men. Thus
the identity of the fundamental process of a reasonable
life with that of the geometrical process, which both
demonstrate the existence of God, is established. The
metaphysical certainty of the first process equals the
geometrical certainty of the second. For this reason
Leibnitz could say, “There are geometry, metaphysics,
harmony, and morality everywhere.”</p>

<p>I have well said that the human Ego used science and
philosophy, before the appearance of philosophers, to attest
that the true path leading to God is that natural movement
of the soul described by the Hindoo poets&mdash;during
a time of great ignorance&mdash;in the Vedic hymns. This
movement is the universal act of prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>For the philosopher, the proof of the existence of God
may appear to rest on a syllogism; for the historian it
rests on the complete evolution of the human mind.</p>

<p>Is it necessary still to ask how the idea of a super-sensible
principle penetrated into the human mind, and
how it is diffused over the world? The reply to this
question is in the Veda, where the hymns show methodically,
under an apparent confusion, what we have been
able to glean here and there from the mouth of sages of
all times. This idea revealed itself to man at first in
external nature; then man discovered it in his own personal
and phenomenal self, the abridgment of humanity in
its entirety with its living and its dead. “At last the
consciousness of self arose from out the clouds of psychological
mythology, and became the consciousness of the
Infinite or the Divine within us. The individual self
found itself again in the Divine Self. Socrates knew it,
but he called it <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Daimonion</i>, the indwelling God. The
early Christian philosophers called it the <em>Holy Ghost</em>, a
name which received many interpretations and misinterpretations
in different schools of theology, but which
ought to become again what it was meant for in the
beginning, the spirit which unites all that is holy within
man, with the Holy of Holies, or the Infinite.”<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> This
may be called natural religion, since it was revealed by
nature, and the truth of this revelation is demonstrated
mathematically.</p>

<p>All that I have just said has been epitomised in a few
lines by a thinker of our century, Bordas-Desmoulins:
“Without mathematics it would be impossible to penetrate
to the depths of philosophy; without philosophy it would
be impossible to arrive at the foundations of mathematics;
without the two we could penetrate nothing.”</p>

<p>Aristotle quotes these words of Anaxagoras, who lived
one hundred and fifty years before him: “The man who<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
recognised in nature an intelligence which is the cause of
the arrangement and order of the universe has alone kept
his reason in the midst of the follies of his predecessors.”</p>

<p>There has been no break in the continuity of the first
impression experienced by man at the sight of lightning,
and God whom each nation named after its own way, and
Him whom the Athenians worshipped without knowing,
whom the Apostle declared to them.</p>

<p>I will here repeat the words of Aristotle, which must
never be effaced from our memories: “Man is face to face
with the light that lighteth every one that cometh into
the world.” It was this that caused the same philosopher
to use those other surprising words, so difficult to grasp
when reading them for the first time in a book: “All
who see see the same things, and all that a man has seen
is true.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_261"><span class="smcap">Anthropomorphism</span></h3>

<p>Man at the beginning, knowing of two kinds of agents
only, both tangible, themselves and the beasts, conceived
the idea that the phenomena of nature were set in
motion by invisible agents of some kind, their imagination
followed its natural bent in picturing these agents
under one or the other of the two aspects familiar to
them, and sometimes under the two united; since these
unknown powers&mdash;for instance amongst the Egyptians&mdash;often
assumed the shape of creatures half man and half
fish, or bird, or quadruped. But with the progress of
civilisation these representations of divinities were modified.
Man having obtained glimpses of the difference
between the phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, was
led to suspect the existence of an author for the one and
the other; and this author or agent was perceived by him
anthropomorphically, that is to say, arrayed with a human
personality, but endowed with all the qualities of goodness<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
and beauty which distinguish the highest and noblest of
men. We know that anthropomorphism in the abstract is
wrong, yet without it man could never have found the
way of approach to this unknown author of all created
things, and the desire to know him nearer was irresistible.</p>

<p>In one sense we are less advanced than our primitive
ancestors. Attracted on the one hand by the occult
properties of the magnet, and impelled by sensation, they
advanced in all simplicity. At a later date they desired
to have those things explained to them which they did
not understand; men undertook this duty, greater distances
grew up between them, and the sacred code was
the result.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_262"><span class="smcap">The Sacred Codes and the Codes of Laws</span></h3>

<p>History teaches us that each sacred Code grew gradually,
and in the same way as the Codes of Laws. A religion
peculiar to each people existed, though vague and indefinite,
before the written Code. If there had not been
a growth of the law by means of decrees, pronounced at
various times by the heads of the people, accumulating
slowly, and accepted in the same degree by the people in
general, there would have been no definite Codes of Laws,
such as those of Solon and Draco and others. If there
had not been a religious growth formulated in oracles and
prayers, and in commandments promulgated at different
times by the prophets, accumulating slowly, and accepted
in the same degree by the people in general, there would
have been no sacred writings, such as those of Moses,
Confucius, Buddha, and others.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that Codes of Laws become transformed
into petrified fetishes, to which submission is blindly
yielded, whilst their origin is forgotten, and the sense of
what is just or unjust is lost in the question of what is
written and thus legal; and some sacred books are treated<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
as fetishes, to which an implicit submission is exacted,
whilst their origin is forgotten and the sense of what is
true and divine is absorbed in the sole thought of what is
written and therefore orthodox.</p>

<p>The sense of responsibility of the citizen with regard to the
law of his country is in danger of becoming paralysed when
that law is applied with such mechanical exactitude as to
confuse the ideas of <em>law</em> and <em>equity</em>;<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and the responsibility
of the believer with regard to the religion of his country
may run risks of becoming paralysed when that religion is
framed in accordance with a ceremonial exactitude rather
than with a human feeling for what is true or false. The
mere possession of the sacred Scriptures may have become
a substitute for the love of God; the effective influence of
the Infinite became changed into a mere habit which
drove away the spontaneous action of the soul. We distinguish
with difficulty organised religions from religions
as practised by each one, which was our primitive religion.
There are rites that we love; rites which at first reflected
God have imperceptibly taken the place of God who vivified
our religious life. We possess dogmas, but lose
perhaps our hold of the personal assurance of the existence
of a Being whom Plato named “the Being apart,” or “the
self-existent Being.” The results of this are serious, since
dogmata, of themselves, do not always furnish sufficing
arguments against atheism.</p>

<p>It may be asked for how many people is this Supreme
Being anything more than a name encountered in a book?
To a small number of individuals He was an intense reality
at intervals during the course of ages, to saints of the
Christian Church and some of the heathen philosophers.
He may still be a reality for certain individualities which
modern philosophies have not classified, as amongst
pantheists or atheists, or minds full of inconsequent enthusiasm.
This Being is also a reality for the erudite mind,<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
or the contemplative who make Him an object of study.
But the greater number of men, even the civilised, the
baptised, are content to pass by; they are satisfied with
the reflection only.</p>

<p>Some might say that it is by means of our reason rather
than of our heart that we are enabled to trace in God
“the Being apart” or “self-existent Being,” but Seneca says:
“Reason is not only composed of evidence; its best part
is obscure and hidden.”</p>

<p>In our days this remark of Seneca’s has been paraphrased
and rendered more in detail, it has been said:
“There are certain minds which are illumined, and there
are others full of warmth; the warmth and the clarity at
times separate, but never the warmth and the nobility; in
the more noble minds there is more warmth.”</p>

<p>If, as Spinoza thought, reason becomes less apt at raising
itself to the knowledge of God, in proportion as imagination
and enthusiasm&mdash;to which it gives rise&mdash;gain in
strength, yet, on the other hand, the world in general
would no doubt have benefited by the work of prophets
which characterised the history of the Hebrew people;
the greater number of intellectual men amongst the ancient
philosophers would not have sought after the knowledge of
God, when it was presented in a form too pure and too
abstract to impress the multitude. The divine conception
therefore descended and captivated them by a union of the
divine and human; and it is because the Bible contains this
universal element that the idea of a supernatural revelation
has become deeply engraved in the human conscience, and
has caused some to consider the Bible as the unique source
of all revelation. For this reason the people of Israel,
though less prone to action than many of whom history
speaks, are, to those who think, the most important
amongst the nations of antiquity, since they have proved,
as none others have done, the power of the spiritual
element in humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>It is displeasing to many persons to hear the term
“Science of Religion” used. “How can a science be
made,” they say, “of what is a natural sentiment? We
can believe without study.” Why do they not add, “and
without reflection?”</p>

<p>Certainly religion did not commence in this world by
study; men first applied themselves to the natural
sciences; they have hardly arrived, at the present time,
at the social sciences; and in the opinion of certain
theologians&mdash;Père Gratry, for instance&mdash;it was several
centuries before the science of religion became known, but
it may be a science without the religious sentiment
suffering in any way. With this view before us, let us
begin not to build but to bring together the materials;
following the advice of the excommunicated philosopher of
Amsterdam, let us look at the sacred writings of the
people in order to form some idea of the different religions,
which is much easier than to know what religion is.</p>

<p>Indifference and ignorance are so common that sometimes
young men are found&mdash;even those about to take
orders&mdash;who would be incapable of answering these
questions: “What are the chief historical religions of our
day? How many are there? Who are their founders?
What are the titles of the sacred writings considered by
these communities as authorities in matters of Faith?”
We know that it is not of Faith to consider that the world
was created in six days of ordinary length, but we do not
know the constitution and names of the religions whence
for thousands of years millions of human creatures have
drawn their hope, their consolation, and their rules of
conduct.</p>

<p>Eight supreme or “book” religions, as Max Müller calls
them, are in possession of Sacred Writings; Brahmanism,
which is the religion of the Veda, and the most ancient of
the Aryan family, with Buddhism form the two religions
of India; Zoroastrianism, or Magism, the Persian religion;<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
two religions in China, one the result of the philosophical
teachings of Lao-tse; the other&mdash;which is more practical&mdash;of
Confucius; Judaism and Christianity; and Mohammedanism,
the religion of Arabia.<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the non-Christian religions, there is one
with which we are little familiar; it seems to have an
attraction for some people, probably because we imagine
it to contain much occult knowledge, which stimulates us
to search for its mysteries; this religion is Buddhism.
With what complacency we discuss it in our drawing-rooms,
without suspecting that we have erred from the
first; we generalise on the religious opinions of millions
of souls separated from us by half the globe, and by
thousands of years, without remembering that these opinions
have varied and continue to vary amongst numerous sects,
just as the dialects of a language vary; and all the time
the fundamental principles of the religion have escaped us.</p>

<p>I shall say a few words only as to Buddhism, and these
will relate first to orthography; it is necessary to distinguish
between the words Buddha and Budha, which
are often confounded; they have nothing in common but
their roots. Buddha with two <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">ds</i> is a participle of <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">budh</i>
which means awakened, or enlightened with a special
light; this name is given to those who have attained
the highest degree of human wisdom; Budha with one <i lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">d</i>
is simply a wise man; and when the Hindoos taught the<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
Greeks a knowledge of the planets, they gave this name to
the planet Mercury.</p>

<p>The custom of immolating the widow on the funeral
pile of her dead husband is naturally spoken of with
astonishment and horror; for many centuries neither the
Hindoos nor Europeans knew that it arose from a mistaken
interpretation of some lines in the Veda.</p>

<p>At last a time arrived when the Brahmans, who were
the religious nobility of the country and had the control of
the Vedic religion, pretended that each word of the Veda
had been supernaturally revealed; voices were now raised
in protest against this affirmation; the Hindoo people, who
submitted patiently to the yoke of political despotism,
would not permit a monopoly of the teaching of eternal
truths; and to shake the authority of the clergy it was
quite sufficient for one man to step forth from amongst
the multitude and assert that it was possible to obtain
eternal happiness without the intervention of the Brahmanic
priesthood, and without a blindfold faith in the
books on which they had placed the seal of infallibility.
Five hundred years before our present era this man
appeared, the son of a king, of the warrior caste, not
belonging to the Brahman class; he was Gautama Sâkya-Muni,
known to the entire world afterwards as the Buddha.
He claimed the right of giving instruction, and handed it on
to others who were also enlightened. Two hundred years
after his death, the famous king Asoka convened a great
council in order to determine the various points of doctrine;
and his edicts were engraved in the Sanscrit dialect then
in use, on rocks in various parts of his kingdom.</p>

<p>If the teaching of Buddha awakened such an ardent
sympathy amongst men, and was propagated with so much
rapidity, it was owing to the fact that the Hindoo mind
had been prepared to receive it by centuries of meditation.</p>

<p>In all probability it was not Buddha who coined the
term Nirvâna; he may have found it ready made in the<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
Upanishads, where it meant originally not annihilation of
the soul, or absorption, but a “blowing out, an extinction,”
then an extinction of passions, a final moral emancipation,
and the union of the individual soul with eternal truth.</p>

<p>In ending this short appreciation of Buddhism, I will
add that, even in our day, there are begging Brahmans,
some living in communities, others dispersed in villages,
who know the entire Rig-Veda by heart, as their ancestors
did three thousand years ago; and although they had
manuscripts and even printed texts they made no use of
them.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of established religions has rendered one
indubitable fact clear to us, that is the deterioration to
which all are subject; none has remained what it was in
its initial period; the most perfect suffers from contact
with the world, in the same way as pure air undergoes a
change when breathed by thousands of lungs.</p>

<p>Christ’s teaching conquered alike the ignorant multitude
and the most civilised portions of the world, because from
the first He used words with which to express the most
exalted truths, which could equally be understood by the
young Jew, the Roman publican, and the Greek philosopher.
Christianity broke down the barrier which divided
nations; until that time everyone who did not speak
Greek, was, to the Greek, a barbarian; to the Jew all the
uncircumcised were strangers; the nascent Christianity drew
white and black together; the idea of the whole human
race forming one family had its birth at the word of
Christ.</p>

<p>The narrowness of outlook disappeared for a time; it
returned when efforts were made to confine the words of
Christ within the narrow compass of a rigid formula; and
thus it came to pass that the recently established doctrine
soon ceased to fulfil its chief object, that of being a link
of universal charity. Zealous disciples, whilst depreciating
dissident religions, endeavoured to detach Christianity from<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
the uninterrupted chain of the government of the world or
divine Providence, thus forming an isolated branch in the
history of the human family.</p>

<p>Each religion, like each language, has a past history,
only we neglect to study the beginnings, because we lose
sight of the fact that the founders of the great religions
claim no exclusive right to the name of sole author.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Justin Martyr, in his <cite>Apology</cite> (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 139), has this
memorable passage (<cite>Apol.</cite> i. 46): “One article of our
faith, then, is that Christ is the true Logos (or universal
Reason) of which mankind are all partakers; and therefore
those who live according to the Logos are Christians,
notwithstanding they may pass with you for atheists;
such among the Greeks were Socrates and Heracleitus, and
the like; and such among the barbarians were Abraham,
and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, and Elias, and many
others; ... and those who have lived in former times in
defiance of the Logos or Reason were evil, and enemies
of Christ, and murderers of such as lived according to the
Logos; but they who have made or make the Logos or
Reason the rule of their actions are Christians, and men
without fear and trembling.”<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>St Augustine, speaking in the same strain, says:
“What is now called the Christian religion, has existed
among the ancients, and was not absent from the beginning
of the human race, until Christ came in the flesh, from
which time the true religion, which existed already, began
to be called Christian” (<cite>Retr.</cite> i. 13).</p>

<p>We know by heart certain passages of the New Testament,
but it is rather the sound than the meaning which
is impressed on our memory; when we come upon similar
remarks made some centuries before the Gospel was<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
preached, they strike us forcibly; and it is as though we
heard them for the first time. Jesus Christ declared
before the assembled multitude: “Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, except a man be born anew, he cannot see the
kingdom of God.” These words were said to a ruler of
the Jews named Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus by
night, and he asked Him to explain how these things
could be. Jesus answered: “Art thou the teacher of
Israel, and understandest not these things?”</p>

<p>No, the teacher of Israel understood not these things,
but the heathen Aristotle knew them; he had said in
speaking of the contemplation of God: “Such a life is
superior to the ordinary life of man; it is not as man that
man lives this life, but by merit of a divine principle living
in him.”</p>

<p>Jesus said unto the woman of Samaria who was sitting
at the foot of Mount Gerizim, a place sacred to those of
her belief: “Woman, believe Me, the hour cometh, when
neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye
worship the Father; ... but the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and truth.” Although nearly
two thousand years have passed men do not yet believe it.</p>

<p>Origen, one of the early Fathers of the Church, wrote:
“If we wish at last to emerge from infancy, we must
translate the temporal and visible Gospel into that which
is eternal and intelligible.” This same Father was condemned
by a council for certain opinions deemed erroneous,
amongst others those on the plurality of worlds, which
he said he found in the Gospel, this opinion might well be
true. St Jerome mentions the anathema used: “Like
Satan, of whom he is the son, Origen fell as lightning from
heaven.” As a piece of eloquence it rivals the condemnation
of the philosopher of Amsterdam.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many legends were disseminated amongst the people,
they were the natural productions of the moral atmosphere<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
of Europe at the time when the first germs of Christianity
sank into a soil strewn with the debris of ancient mythology.
What happened then will always happen when the
multitudes learn the language of their rulers without at the
same time assimilating their ideas.</p>

<p>It is related that in the thirteenth century, in a little
town of Italy, a Brother Thomas asked Brother Bonaventure
whence came the power and unction of which all
his sermons were so full. Bonaventure pointed to a
crucifix hanging on the wall of his cell: “He it is who
dictates to me all that I say.” This reply was reported to
the people, who believed it literally, and the inhabitants
of the town were convinced that Brother Bonaventure possessed
a crucifix that spoke. The painters adopted the
subject, amongst the first were those of Spain. Thus a
symbol took the place of a sacred truth.</p>

<p>The Church has often been accused of tolerating like
superstitions; yet she endeavours to stop their propagation;
but the task of trying to restore each stone to its
place is one of great delicacy, lest the foundations should
be shaken upon which the spiritual life of long centuries
has been built. Miracles are a prominent feature in all
religions; nevertheless, when the disciples of Buddha
asked their master to enable them to perform them,
he replied: “I will teach you to perform the greatest
moral miracle. Hide your good deeds, and confess before
the world the sins you have committed” (<cite>Phy. Religion</cite>,
p. 339).</p>

<p>Mohammed, in the Koran, expresses the strongest contempt
for miracles, in the usual sense of that word, and he
appeals to the true miracles, the great works of Allah in
nature: “I cannot show you,” he said to his disciples,
“signs more wonderful than what you see every day and
every night.” But the orthodox Mohammedans delight in
relating the miracles wrought by Mohammed, and which
have made him the marvel of Arabia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>Miracles seem to serve the purpose of impressing upon
us that the religion is true in which name they are performed;
it has also been observed that the same miracle
is not generally performed twice, as the second time it
appears natural; it is extraordinary the faculty man
possesses of feeling no astonishment at those things which
should awaken his most profound astonishment.</p>

<p>As critics we are now in a position to take note of the
mental aberrations of the mythological period; we can
understand that when the ancient peoples attributed a
divine descent to their kings and heroes, it was the
highest praise that one man could give to another; we
know that the mythology as taught in the schools, was
no more the religion of the Greeks and Romans than rust
is iron. Yet it is this homage which has perhaps obscured
our minds as we imagine absolutely human intercourse
taking place between mortals and immortals. The action
of metaphor overstepped the boundary of the fabulous
ages; it invaded, unknown to us, the domain of the
modern thinker, and even our religion was not sheltered
from its attacks; we now use in our religious phraseology
the words of <em>father</em> and <em>son</em>, without having first despoiled
them of their material meaning; and we hardly realise
that in this different sphere these words are a daring
metaphor, upon which, of our own initiative, we could not
have ventured. A vague idea that God is separated from
us by space dominates us, so that the belief that there
can be no barrier between the divine and human is often
confounded with pantheism; yet without pantheism of this
kind, which differs <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</i> from the dogmatic pantheism,
Christianity would not have made its appearance in the
world. We invoke neither Jupiter nor Jehovah; God is
for us the God whose name is found in all modern
languages; but it is God around us, beyond us; in
speaking of Him our thoughts follow Him to Heaven.
When a man takes God to witness of his innocence, he<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
involuntarily lifts his hand to Heaven; in a time of
disastrous drought, when the earth refuses its nourishment
to man and beast, pious souls are invited to pray to God
for the blessing of rain. Whilst the work of science has
been specially directed to causes, religion is content, as
in the past, to attribute each act to an agent; the influence
of ancient ideas on our present thought is still in force,
and our mind has to live as the oyster, under a cover
which it has made for itself. But we must submit to
evidence, and acknowledge that if we do not yet escape
from the power of mythology, it is that we meet its
language everywhere, even in our sacred writings.</p>

<p>Language has moulded our thoughts; when they tend
towards God, we make a representation of Him as a
person, we are not able to avoid such representations;
we know that the sun does not rise each morning, but
we cannot do otherwise than see it rise; we know that the
sky is not blue, but to us it wears no other appearance.</p>

<p>We hear it repeated that an impersonal God is no
God; but it is forgotten that personification implies
limitations, since it cannot be conceived but from a
human point of view, and thus with limits. When Spinoza
denied a Divine personality, his opposers believed him to
be denying God; the philosophers of the seventeenth
century, including Catholic theologians, did not define
the personality of God.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Descartes and Fenelon’s definition
is “The Infinitely perfect Being, without restrictions,
the Being, to which nothing can be added.” In regarding
God’s personality as we do that of a human being, we
might logically say with Massillon: “God, in His anger,
hears unwise prayers, in order to punish those who use
them”; you would also be logical if you thought with
that mother that God had taken away her child because
she had loved it too well.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>
<p>In tracing the progress of ideas concerning God throughout
the course of ages, it would be a sorry task to gather
together the characteristics chosen by Christian writers as
those which mark the supreme Being; these traits would
furnish a whole Pantheon of mythological divinities.</p>

<p>All philosophers and all truly philosophical theologians
have held that God is impersonal Reason; Bossuet called
Him “La Raison-Dieu.” This Light that lighteth every
one that cometh into the world is the source of a principle
of certitude; Aristotle, St Augustine, St Thomas Aquinas
thus understood it when they said that mind cannot be
mistaken.</p>

<p>If we would make an approximate conception of God
we must scrupulously follow the advice of St Thomas
Aquinas, “Eliminate, eliminate,” then only shall we understand
the meaning of the sages who said that negation
is fuller than affirmation.</p>

<p>Thousands of years before St Thomas Aquinas, the
Hindoos practised his method; for it was the inadequacy
of the names used to express the indefinable attributes of
divinity that led them always to search for new ones, until
at last, all the phenomena of nature having been examined
and rejected, the Hindoos in despair cried, “It is impossible
to seize that which we seek; it is not this, nor that, nor
anything for which we have a name.” At last they came
to the conclusion that there was no name worthy of God
in the language of humanity, and that all that could be
said was, “No, no.”</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to use names as soon as we
possess the ideas. All those which have contributed to
the education of humanity have been the production of
an impersonal work, the result of a long meditation by the
human mind. It has been said that the idea and name
of “the Being” for God, originated in the mind of Moses;
perhaps this prophet put the last touch. “I Am that I
Am” was the name used by him for the Eternal. The<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
Hebrews employed another method when speaking of God,
they used the word Il or El. In Hebrew it occurs both
in its general sense of strong or hero, and as a name of
God. Something equivalent is found in the Zend-Avesta;
“Looking around him, Il (Ahuramazda, the Zend name
for Ormazd) sees nothing but himself; and Il said, ‘I
Am,’ and his name became ‘I Am.’”</p>

<p>But man at times yearns for a closer union with God
than is expressed by the name “Being.” When troubled
and in pain he says, “My Father!” and he remembers the
names which he lisped as a child, and all come crowding
to his lips; and He who is above all hears and understands.</p>

<p>We must not separate religion from philosophy; the
subjects touching on religion have always been those
which have given birth to philosophy; even if religion
existed only on sentiment, as some people maintain, it
would be for philosophy to determine if this sentiment
were an illusion, or if it had a rational base; to separate
them is to lessen both.</p>

<p>If language is the true autobiography of the human mind,
our present language may also be called a perfect photograph
of our mind in its present state of fog. Whether
ignorant or learned we still talk and discuss, and we seldom
arrive at an understanding of the subject, owing to our
want of knowledge of the precise meaning of the terms.
The most advanced sciences are those about whose terms
we no longer dispute, mathematics, for instance. When
we are quite convinced of the identity of thought and
speech, we shall introduce into our ideas, and consequently
into all our discourses, whether familiar or philosophical,
a clearness impossible to obtain in any other manner.</p>

<p>It would be a great help to know the etymology of
words, but that would not suffice. “L’étymologie,” said
Voltaire, “est une science où les voyelles ne font rien, et
les consonnes fort peu de choses.” This sally bears on its
face the date of the century of which this could be said in
all truth. At the time of Voltaire the science of etymology
was confined to ascribing the derivation of a word to
another word to which it bore a close resemblance in
sound; and the clever writer was not the only one to
rally the few learned men who considered it possible to
trace words to a source which one can hardly suspect of
being related to them. If Voltaire had known that his
sarcasm was nothing more than a simple scientific truth,
he would perhaps have found less pleasure in expressing<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
it. The science of etymology&mdash;a growth of our day&mdash;has
discovered that words, which in appearance have nothing
in common, neither sound nor meaning, yet have a
common origin.</p>

<p>That would be a curious chapter of the history of
thought, in which were demonstrated the errors that had
been introduced and embedded in our minds by the use
of certain words, which in the course of time gradually
developed a meaning the exact opposite of that which they
had at the first.</p>

<p>For instance, matter is generally represented as something
tangible, that is to say, all are agreed in finding it
devoid of mind, and it is a sign of condemnation to say of
a century it is materialistic. Yet we who daily touch
tangible objects, such as stone, metal, wood, never succeed
in putting our hands on matter as such; we should not
know where to find it. Does this arise from the fact that
matter is not tangible? The Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">materia</i> had
originally the meaning of the wood of a tree, then of wood
or timber for building. This meaning was generalised so
as to include solid bodies capable of taking various shapes.
When idols were fashioned a distinction was made between
the wood and the shape which emerged; and afterwards,
when sculptors carved statues of marble or of metal, the
marble and metal again received the name of matter or
material; and when it was asked of what all tangible
objects were made, even the world on which we live, the
answer was that all were made of matter whilst they
differ in form. In this way have we become possessed
of our word matter, to which nothing tangible quite
corresponds; and no doubt, owing to its complexity of
meaning, it has not ceased to exercise the minds of
learned men.</p>

<p>If philosophers have not been able to explain accurately
the meaning of matter, physicists have not been more
successful, since what we call matter does not come under<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
our senses. The word might have escaped this ill fate
had it always been used only by philosophers “who try
only to use words that have been clearly defined, but
names are used by the wise and the foolish, and the
foolish, as we know, are in such an immense majority that
the wonder is that words have any definite sense left at
all.”<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Max Müller says: “I am quite willing to admit that
matter may be called the objective cause of all that we
perceive. For the very reason, however, that it is a
cause, matter can never fall under the cognisance of our
senses. All that we can predicate of matter is that it
causes our sensations, that it exists in space and time, that
it is one, but appears under an endless variety of phenomenal
forms, that it remains unchanged in the change of
outward appearances.”<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The history of the word matter teaches us then that
speech, whose sole duty it is to introduce light into our
minds, admits error also as long as we are ignorant of the
original meaning of words: matter, whilst it was the solid
wood of a tree and wood for building, became for those
who had coined the word a fit object for perception and
conception; later, others, differently constituted, saw in it
a word “which contains to every man exactly what he
has found in it or added to it.”<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>There are many words whose transformations we are
able to follow from one language to another, but, on the
other hand, there are others whose history it is not
possible to know with exactness, owing to the many revolutions,
the many breaks and pauses which here and there
have destroyed and scattered the links; but the science of
language progresses, and those who study it look forward
to the day when its foundations will be placed on philosophical
bases.</p>

<p>Many of the false ideas we have conceived of words are<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
no doubt owing to the translations we read of books.
When we first begin the study of a new language the task
appears a simple one, the dictionary supplies us with the
equivalent words and the grammar with the correct forms;
but the further we advance the less we are satisfied; the
difficulties of finding expressions which content us increase;
words are too abundant, or too scarce; our conceptions are
invaded by ideas of complete disparity; and we seem to
be entering an unknown land, because new effects of light
and shade have lent a novel character to the country. A
translation is therefore at best but an effort to bring
together thoughts which were designed to remain always
apart.</p>

<p>If in our modern languages certain words necessarily
change their meaning during the course of three or four
centuries, ancient languages are under the same necessity
in an infinitely greater degree.</p>

<p>Many scholars have devoted their entire lives to the
task of deciphering old documents, as it is impossible for
literature of an age anterior to our present era by many
centuries to preserve its original physiognomy two thousand
years later. A translation of the hymns of the Veda, or
of the Zend-Avesta, requires exactly the same process as
the deciphering of the inscriptions in the time of Cyrus,
Darius, and Xerxes. The only certain way is to compare
every passage in which the same word occurs, and look for
a meaning that is equally applicable to all. From the
lack of this method Sanscrit and Zend texts have been
rendered most incorrectly. It is precisely the Sacred
Writings that have suffered the most from the efforts of
interpreters. Those passages of the hymns which have no
close connection with religious or philosophical doctrines
are generally correctly rendered, but as each generation
expects to find the ideas reflecting its own time in the
words of the ancient seers, the most simple discourse&mdash;if
it can in any way be construed to represent modern<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
thought&mdash;is tortured and twisted so as to coincide with
preconceived ideas, however foreign to the mind of the
writer.</p>

<p>It is the same with the Hebrew version of the Old
Testament. At the time when the seventy Jews at
Alexandria were occupied in translating the Scriptures
into Greek, 250 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, although Hebrew could not be
looked upon as a dead language, yet even the most learned
amongst these elders did not understand the original of
many of the expressions, and probably few of the translators
undertook the task of explaining how far those
to whom Moses’ discourses were addressed, understood
them.</p>

<p>If the Old Testament has lost amongst the Higher Critics
some of its ancient glories, it has, on the other hand,
acquired a historical value which theologians of former
times had never contemplated. The knowledge of comparative
philology having been used in deciphering the
cuneiform inscriptions or hieroglyphics engraved on the
ruined walls of the temples and palaces of Nineveh and
Babylon, we possess information concerning the worship of
the Phœnicians, the Carthaginians, and the Nomads of the
Arabian peninsula. We no longer seek the help of the
inscriptions in proving the truth of the biblical records; it
is rather these which confirm the correctness of all that we
learn from the inscriptions.</p>

<p>One more remark on the subject of our venerable and
venerated Bible. I do not understand how it is that some
people with literary tastes never open the Old Testament
to satisfy them. Lack of habit perhaps. Some of the
wits of the Renaissance looked down on the Old Testament;
now the admirers of classic literature know better how to
appreciate its literary beauties of many kinds of which it
is full; some of our modern writers have been much
commended for their perorations; the perorations of the
chapters contained in the Bible are superb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>“I will give an instance how the peculiar character of
a language may influence even religious expressions. A
Mohawk (coming originally from North America) was
questioned concerning his mother-tongue. It seems that
in Mohawk it is impossible to say father, mother, child,
nor the father, the mother, the child. We must always
say, my father, thy mother, or his child. Once when I
asked him to translate the Apostles’ Creed for me, he
translated ‘I believe in our God, our Father, and his
Son’ all right. But when he came to the Holy Ghost,
he asked is it <em>their</em> or <em>his</em> Holy Ghost? I told him there
was a difference of opinion on that point between two
great divisions of the Christian Church, and he then
shook his head and declared that he could not translate
the Creed till that point had been settled.”<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This fact has
an interest for linguists; what I am about to relate concerns
all.</p>

<p>A lady wishing to practise a little philosophy with the
means within her reach, wrote to me once: “I am perplexed;
my heart tells me one thing, and my soul
another.” It required some moments of reflection to
understand what my correspondent meant; the heart was,
in her eyes, obviously, the seat of earthly affections; and
the soul that of purely spiritual aspirations. This hazy
manner of explanation might, at first sight, appear harmless,
but on looking at it more closely, it is seen to be
unfortunate, for this confusion between thoughts and
words, meets one in many a book of so-called edification,
where the reader seldom takes note of it, especially if he
be hurried or careless; but one regrets to see good women
waste daily half an hour in reading such indefinite
nothings, thinking to accomplish thereby a religious duty;
these persons, with intellectual culture would draw greater
benefit to themselves in devoting their half hour to the
perusal of books of a more sturdy tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[282]</span></p>

<p>We believe ourselves to be in the possession of very
clear notions concerning conscience; earnest men speak of
it as an inward monitor; simple folk like ourselves call it
the Voice of God; for the one and for the other conscience
seems to be a guide on which they can rely, and the Greek
poet Menander was not mistaken when he wrote the line
“Conscience is a god to all mortals.” But if we possessed
within us a faculty to tell us what is our duty, how could
Pascal have said that good and evil differ with a few
degrees of latitude? It is a well-known fact that the
conscience of a Mormon speaks another language to that
of a non-Mormon. We say with truth that we are conscious
of having done well or ill, but it does not follow
that it is to our conscience that we owe the fact of
knowing right from wrong; this consciousness is the
result of instruction from without, which we accept when
our own judgment and our own experience demonstrate its
truth.</p>

<p>In subjects of general interest, the task of defining
terms should consist in choosing amongst the various
interpretations which have gradually become attached to
certain words, not always that one which is most intimately
or etymologically connected with the primary root, but
that which would indicate an important practical difference.
Yet by an unforeseen misfortune, the daily necessity
comes before us of using words whose meaning has never
been clearly defined, so that at no time has one meaning
prevailed more than another; this is especially the case
with words connected with religion, faith, and objects
of belief, which each one understands after his own
manner.</p>

<p>In our days the possibility of an agreement between
religion and science is often debated; how can we enter
on the discussion without being quite clear as to what
religion is? According to some it is simply the feeling of
love for God; according to others it is the expression of<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
our faith under the form of acts of worship, acts of charity,
or perhaps the holding of certain dogmas.</p>

<p>The same holds good with that which we call faith, and
which is often a feeling of confidence&mdash;not always the
result of thought&mdash;in the faith of those surrounding us.
Some give the name of faith to that enthusiasm which has
sufficed to cause men joyfully to meet martyrdom; others
apply it to the confidence with which the wise men
followed the guiding of the star, when it indicated the
road they should follow. Faith is only worthy of the
name when it can be said to be a reasonable faith, and
thus accounting for its existence. If we are not amongst
the number of those who can give a reason for the faith
that is in them, we must take care that credulity does not
glide in before we are aware of its approach; it arises from
a weakness of the mind and is compatible with a tranquillity
that differs very widely from peace; and when
once mistress of the situation, it increases, and occupies it.
A wise Arab well said, “He who builds his house on human
credulity builds on a rock.”</p>

<p>“Abstract,” this word which we can trace back to
Aristotle, has an interesting history. Aristotle used it at
first to characterise the creation of a work of art; the
sculptor carves out of a block of marble the statue of a
man or of a woman, rejecting the chips and dust which
serve no purpose. Afterwards Aristotle applied this same
word to an idea which an accurate thinker forms, giving
it a suitable shape, and separating it from all accidental
thoughts that may have surrounded it; that done, what
remains is an abstract idea. Aristotle has so well explained
the meaning of abstract, that if our logicians had simply
spoken of <em>concrete</em> as that which is non-abstract, all the
world would more readily have understood the meaning of
the word&mdash;concrete.</p>

<p>We possess and employ a vast number of words, and
we apparently increase them by endowing the same word&mdash;from<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
a want of clearness in our perceptions&mdash;with
various meanings. The ancient Hindoos must have felt
that an over-abundance of words is pernicious, and for this
reason, no doubt, the Brahmans at a certain period of their
literature, imposed on themselves the rule of expressing
their thoughts in the fewest words possible. They succeeded
in presenting each point of doctrine denuded of all
but the barest outline of words; they are the authors of
the aphorism, “A writer of the Sutras is happier in having
economised a portion of a diphthong than from the birth
of a son.” The full force of this sentence becomes apparent
when it is remembered that the Brahman who has no son
to perform his funeral rites cannot hope to enter heaven.
It would be difficult to express more forcibly a respect for
words, and the great necessity there is for cultivating
clearness of thought.</p>

<p>What I am about to say concerns a word to which I
owe the direction of my views of life, and my resolution to
undertake the study of the subjects forming my present
work; this word is the name of a man.</p>

<p>When I was young I made the acquaintance of a very
learned Jesuit Father who employed his time in researches
on the ecclesiastical antiquities of the East. We once found
ourselves in the company of certain persons who were
surveying the most remarkable of all the scientific and
philosophical works published in our day; Darwin, Pasteur,
Helmholtz and Max Müller were named. When the
reverend Father heard this last name, he exclaimed, with
his accustomed impetuosity, “Oh! Max Müller, his works
are absolutely magnificent.”</p>

<p>Twenty years later the announcement of a new work of
Max Müller reminded me of the Jesuit Father’s exclamation;
hitherto I had read nothing of this author’s; I
procured the book which had appeared recently; afterwards
I read those that had preceded it. At the end<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
of some years I wrote to the reverend Father; the state
of his health had obliged him to settle in a town in the
south, and I had not seen him for some time. I thanked
him for having drawn my attention to Max Müller’s name.
I received an immediate reply, the first lines of which I
will quote. “Your thanks are unexpected. Max Müller
seems to me an incomparable philosopher, but my admiration
does not surpass his merit.” A few weeks later the
worthy Father died of consumption.</p>

</div>


<p>I had not decided beforehand on the number of my
chapters; it seems that there will be thirteen. If these
pages have readers to whom the number thirteen is
distressing, I beg of them at once to dismiss this feeling
by saying: “He who objects to sit down thirteen at table,
acknowledges by this that he does not believe in a
supreme intelligence, superior to his own, which governs
the world.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Science, religion, reason, and faith, these four words
form the circle in which all intellects move, now more than
ever; on this all the world is agreed, but all the world
does not know what the greatest thinkers have understood
by these four words.</p>

<p>If we do not wish to deserve the title given to that
collective being, “the man in the street,” the best means
of avoiding it is to acknowledge openly that there are
many unexplained problems facing us, and that man exists
in order to do his part in solving them. Humanity is not
composed of individuals who have been poured forth from
a horn of plenty, its destiny cannot therefore be to diffuse
itself over the surface of the earth without the means of
knowing why it is there.</p>

<p>An ancient Greek said once that the gods were ready
to sell all kinds of good things to mortals but at a high
price, at the cost of hard work. If then we can only
acquire the promised good things by the aid of hard
work, our thoughts carry us at once to science, and we<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
ask what can this science do, upon which we so pride
ourselves in this century, to explain the motive of our
existence?</p>


<h3 id="Ref_287"><span class="smcap">Physics</span></h3>

<p>In proportion as physical science studies this universe,
so it recognises more and more clearly that its most
general phenomenon is vibration, a periodical movement,
which propagates itself in waves succeeding each other at
regular intervals.</p>

<p>We have all noticed the effect produced by drops of
rain falling on water which the absence of wind leaves
perfectly tranquil. Each drop forms a circle, but the
causes of perturbation of an aqueous surface are infinite;
the dip of an insect, the leap of a fish, all ceaselessly
cause new circles, which follow each other, become wider,
and finally lose themselves in each other under our eyes;
the water is apparently a prey to shivering fits; this is
a type of the vibrations whose percussions are felt by the
whole world. We are all, body and soul, subject to the
law of vibrations, each sense recognises its power by means
of sensations whose various kinds are apprehended by
physical science, by the calculation of the number of
vibrations which, in a given time, affect differently each
of our organs of sensation. Science records the number
of vibrations which denote to our skin the exact degree
of the external temperature, she counts the millions of
vibrations which enable our eyes to see definite colours in
the space of a second, and the thousands of vibrations
which enable our ears to hear, in the same space of time,
well defined sounds.</p>

<p>Thus physical science explains a general phenomenon
which exerts its influence, indubitably, on all men since
there have been men on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>


<h3 id="Ref_288"><span class="smcap">Comparative Sciences</span></h3>

<p>When Bordas-Desmoulins, one of the first of our learned
thinkers to study comparative science, said: “Without
mathematics we cannot plumb the depths of philosophy;
without philosophy we cannot penetrate mathematics;
without the two we can reach the foundation of nothing,”
did he see that this truth is so great as to be all
embracing?</p>

<p>We see theologians walking steadily in the footsteps of
those who study comparative science with conviction.
Father Gratry contends that without it it is impossible
to know God, man, and nature. Matter cannot be conceived
without spirit, nor spirit apart from matter. Whilst
a human being is in the embryonic stage, the soul, the
principle of life, is occupied in forming the body, destined
to cover it during its earthly existence. The moment
arrives when this body is sufficiently prepared to appear
in the light of day; it contains two nervous centres, the
one supplying the vegetative life, the other the animal;
they are distinct though not separated, and the soul still
continues its work on the body, whether it sleeps or
whether it wakes; but during sleep, whilst man’s will is
torpid, the soul supplies by rhythmic movements of the
nerves, the requisite matter for the reparation of the
losses sustained during the waking periods.</p>

<p>This intimate union of mind and matter has been
rejected by certain great philosophers. Descartes, for
instance, completely separated the immaterial substance
possessed of the property of thinking from the material
body. Apparently we are of his way of thinking since
we always speak of our soul as of one thing and our body
as of another; this is to make two truths out of one and
the same truth. But it is better to look upon it as one
truth as Aristotle did formerly. At a later date certain
doctors of the Church became of the same opinion, and at<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
present Christian theologians, who are also thinkers, hold
the same view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A fresh science is now in process of development. It
connects psychical phenomena, such as sensation, thought,
and action, with that which can be weighed and measured.
This science bears several more or less characteristic names;
in order to keep to generalities I will call it the new
psychology; it is taught in Germany, England, Paris,
and Russia, and perhaps elsewhere. There is only one
way of dealing rightly with so vast a science, it should
be treated in its entirety; but as I am anxious only to
make known some of its more recent discoveries, I will
content myself by doing this briefly and with many
omissions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kant had as his disciple the physiologist J. Müller, who
applied the method of his master to the study of sensations;
and Helmholtz was trained by J. Müller.</p>

<p>At one time, rather more than fifty years ago, the germs
of life were considered to be an exception on the terrestrial
globe; but Helmholtz discovered them even in rocky
masses; and he proved to Liebig that putrefaction was
not a simple chemical reaction, but was due to the action
of a living organism. M. Pasteur was one of the first to
profit by this lesson.</p>

<p>Each definite science has its own special sphere in which
it is occupied only with itself; Helmholtz, a physician and
musician, worked entirely in connection with his own
science only; without reference to the conclusion that
comparative science might draw from his labours, he gave
himself up to the study of the rapidity of the transmission
of nervous impressions, and dogmatically laid down his
thesis in his book <cite>The Physiological Theory of Music</cite>,
which is perhaps the most important of his works; at
least it is the one of which I have made the most use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[290]</span></p>

<p>In nature we never hear simple sounds; nothing but
a fusion of noises reaches us. Helmholtz, however, succeeded
in distinguishing a fundamental sound in a mass
of others; but it is quickly amalgamated with two or
three other sounds which are higher and feebler than
itself, as distant echoes. Helmholtz became convinced
that music is composed of single sounds accompanied by
others of a decreasing intensity, and he demonstrated by
calculation that the number of vibrations of these secondary
sounds called harmonics are greater than those of the
fundamental sounds; and the differences of the grouping
of harmonic sounds determines the difference of timbre.
In this way Helmholtz discovered the cause of musical
timbre, and was able to explain the reason, hitherto
unknown, of the sound of a flute differing from that
of a hautbois, or of a woman’s voice from that of
a man’s.</p>

<p>There are two marvellous things in music; timbre and
rhythm.</p>

<p>By rhythm is understood the number of a group of
corresponding vibrations recurring in a second. Rhythm
may be defined as a recurring movement, composed of
unequal parts; the beat of a pulse, in which each pulsation
can be separately distinguished, will serve as an example.</p>

<p>Rhythm may be found everywhere, in poetry equally
with music; and it is this which imparts its chief charm.
The beauty of the rhythmic prose of the Hebrew Nābhī
naturally attracted the multitude independently of the
subject matter of their words; and the rhythmic language
of Renan’s translation of the book of Job enables us perfectly
to grasp and appreciate the special charm incidental
to rhythm.</p>

<p>Music is provocative of nervous effects, at times of great
intensity; beneficent to the greater number of persons, but
to others quite the reverse; in his infancy Mozart almost
fainted on hearing the sound of the trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[291]</span></p>

<p>Professor Wundt&mdash;who in his works deals with the
human soul and that of beasts&mdash;founded at Leipzig, in
1879, a laboratory with this inscription over the entrance,
“Institute for Experimental Psychology.” Wundt said:
“The result of my researches does not accord with the
dualism of Plato and Descartes; from experimental
psychology the animism of Aristotle (who connects psychology
and biology) alone is evolved, as the plausible metaphysical
conclusion.”</p>

<p>A wonderful man this Aristotle! Whether we wish
to analyse those sensations which stir every fibre of our
moral being, or to trace the etymology of a word, or study
the most modern of all our sciences, the first to present
himself to our mental vision is the sage of Stageira.</p>

<p>The first notes of an air by Mozart or of a sonata of
Beethoven could never have been produced by them by
chance, they were willed by a power which their composers
considered outside themselves.</p>

<p>Inspiration&mdash;revelation&mdash;the same thing with all, in all
time, and in every place, they differ but in degree. It is
possible that a musical physician such as Helmholtz, added
to a psychological physiologist as Wundt was, and the two
grafted on to a philosopher such as Aristotle, might have
been able to define, in a measure, the meaning of the words
Inspiration and Revelation.</p>

<p>It is with a knowledge of causes that we are able to
say: “The universal phenomenon of vibration is a fight
for life, a fight between <em>being</em> and <em>not being</em>.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_291"><span class="smcap">Concerning Some Authors</span></h3>

<p>We do not always occupy ourselves with science, and
writers of a poetical temperament like to write on the
more serious subjects, at the dictation of their heart and
conscience only, especially when they speak to themselves
alone, with no thought of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>Renan, in his <cite>History of the People of Israel</cite>, writes:
“In presence of the social problems of our days, and of
the question: Has life a premeditated end and object?
What is it? Is it for the good of humanity? Is it for
the good of the individual?” The author replies: “The
universe, whose last word we never learn, attains its end
by an infinite variety of germs; if we are amongst those
who deceive themselves and rebel against authority, that
may not be attended by serious consequences ... let us
be quiet; if we miss the mark others will hit it; that
which Jahvah wills, will come to pass.”</p>

<p>Understand if you can.</p>

<p>Those who wish to adore, always find an object of adoration;
Renan seeks his religion in the love of science and
art; Comte thought to find it in a life devoted to
the happiness of humanity. Is it not of these, and of
men similar to them, that the most intellectual and
clearest sighted of judges, the mythological god Krishna,
spoke when he said, “All those who adore idols, adore
me.”</p>

<p>Everywhere we encounter God and His power; either
He triumphs over man, or man vainly seeks to triumph
over Him.</p>

<p>I have noticed that Renan’s work, <cite>La Vie de Jésus</cite>, to
which earnest-minded persons have a great objection, has
been the means of consoling more than one sincere soul.
Is it to be reckoned a good or an evil? Who shall take
upon himself to say? Renan has certainly an attraction
for certain readers, they do not succeed in finding out
what he believes, but that is not to the point; generally
he confines himself to troubling the water, it becomes
muddy; in muddy waters fish are sometimes taken&mdash;we
throw our lines&mdash;and&mdash;marvellous&mdash;each one draws out
his favourite fish.</p>

<p>Père Gratry has nothing in common with Renan, except
that both are poets. Plato having said that all but the<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
wicked have their eternal types in God, Gratry was
authorised in the conclusion he drew in his <cite>Logic</cite> that
“nothing in us, neither sentiment, nor imagination, nor
prayer, can go too far; all is more beautiful than that of
which we dream; all is higher than we can believe
possible.”</p>

<p>This language has displeased certain moralists, and they
have not spared their censures on the theologian who used
it. They have accused him of dreaming whilst dealing
with religion, and they would have preferred that Gratry
should occupy himself simply with literature. “Above
all,” they say, “how is it that Gratry has ventured to
write five long chapters on the probable site of immortality,
and to inquire where men will live when there
is no longer death.”</p>

<p>Why should we not be permitted to ask ourselves these
questions, and to reply to them as we please? Are not
theologians men like ourselves? Especially that theologian
who said: “The time when religion will have
acquired the characteristics of a science is yet far
distant.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_293"><span class="smcap">Religion and Religions</span></h3>

<p>At an early period of our present era, various groups of
men formed themselves into assemblies, “Churches,” as
they were called, all teaching religion, and each from his
own point of view. The study of these instructions is full
of important lessons. First is to be noticed this fact that
the truths on which all were agreed weighed more heavily
in the balance than those on which they disagreed. It is
necessary to disentangle true religion in itself from its
surroundings. There is one true religion, as there is one
God, and one logic. The expressions which are current
with us of natural religion and revealed religion should be<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
lacking in our conversation, since they cause us to believe
that they denote two different religions.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Opinions are sometimes attributed to the founders of
organised religions which really belong only to their disciples,
or even to theologians who live in an age much
more recent than the historical birth of the religion; if
free discussion followed, suppositions and doubts might
often be dissipated, but in certain cases laws are imposed
and rules laid down which are considered infallible and
not open to discussion.</p>

<p>According to the early Christian Doctors, the Church is
external and visible, together with that which is within
and invisible; the title, “Soul of the Church,” was given
to the invisible union of men amongst themselves and with
God; its dogma is, “All the righteous, none but the
righteous can have their share in the soul of the Church;
many are in the visible Church who do not belong to its
soul; many are out of the visible Church who form a
portion of the soul of the Church.”<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In speaking thus the Fathers rested on an ancient
tradition; it came to them from Plato, whose words I
have already quoted: “There is in the soul a point, which
is the root by which the Divinity suspends his creatures to
Himself; and this central point is the truth which connects
all men from one end of the world to the other.”
This explains the previous assertion of the Fathers.</p>

<p>But they did not content themselves with an assertion
only; they imposed on reason the burden of explanation
and the duty of knowing all. The first effort of our reason
in natural sciences consists in examining facts and endeavouring
to find the laws. If one eternal law did not<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
rule over the whole of nature our labour would be in
vain; if this same law did not govern our reason we
should be incapable of finding those laws which govern
the phenomena around us; and it is clear that there could
consequently be no physical science. But it is not so
apparent at first sight that if our reason were not governed
by an eternal law, there could be no moral sciences either.</p>

<p>Many observations have been made by men of attentive
and profound minds, but they have remained isolated for
the most part. I will quote one or two that I have
collected here and there; it is well to pass them in
review, if only to assure one’s self that they are true.</p>

<p>“It is a great mistake to suppose that those who have
read many books know many things. Reading supplies
the material for knowledge, but reflection alone causes it to
take root and grow.” Locke made this observation. I add
to it that for reflection to bear fruit it must be joined to a
good method. Père Gratry, who is a practical man, also
enforces this in a chapter in his <cite>Logic</cite>, in which he lays
great stress on the importance of reserving the morning
hours for study and reflection. It is a fine paragraph, and
worthy of being reproduced.</p>

<p>“In the book of the Apocalypse we read, ‘And there
was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour.’ In
the heaven of souls this is rare. According to St Augustine
the Eternal Wisdom does not cease to speak to human
creatures, and reason does not cease its activities in us.
We have only to listen, and to listen we must keep silence.
But amongst men, and especially amongst thinkers, who
can keep still silence? The generality of men, especially
those who study, have not a single half hour of silence in
the day, men of learning either listen to those who speak,
or are speaking themselves; and when they find themselves
alone and silent, then they permit books to speak
to them, and they devour long discourses, with rapid
glances, in a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>Under these conditions all study requiring much reflection
is impossible.</p>

<p>Attention, Abstraction, Contradiction, Speech&mdash;only a
few persons appreciate the importance of these four words,
and hardly any one doubts that they know the part played
in their lives by the things which these words represent.</p>

<p>If we wish to know ourselves many subjects of all kinds
must be studied simultaneously; religion and religions;
the opinions of the ancients and of our contemporaries;
men as they now are and as they were. Renan has well
characterised primitive men in attributing to them “a
special feeling for nature which enabled them, with
wonderful delicacy and accuracy, of which we have no
conception, to perceive the qualities which furnished
names; and they saw innumerable things at once.”</p>

<p>The Hindoos, who were writers many centuries before
our present era, must have inherited from their primitive
ancestors this special feeling for nature, or they would not
have composed those verses in the 129th hymn: “Everything
in the beginning was hidden in gloom&mdash;the germ
which was covered by the husk was brought forth by the
power of heat. On this germ rested love, the spring of
the mind, yes, and the poets, in meditating thereon,
discovered in their souls the tie between the things created
and the things uncreated.&mdash;This spark, comes it from the
earth, piercing all, penetrating into all, or comes it from
heaven?”</p>

<p>These passages have something modern in them; they
might have been written now when science seeks to fuse
heaven and earth, which was not done formerly.</p>

<p>The cord does not cease to vibrate. The persistence of
this phenomenon has different comments made on it. “It
is the effect of heredity,” says modern science; “it is a
contemporaneous effect of the fall,” says theology. Perhaps
the one and the other make of the human race one unique
being which continues through the ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>It is as though time had no existence for humanity.
Space also apparently does not count for much with the
race. If the singular facts are true which we hear, two
persons separated by a great distance have the same
thoughts at the same instant; not the universal thought
naturally inherent in the human mind, but entirely
personal. Has sympathy&mdash;which is as essentially human
as it is mysterious&mdash;a relationship with electricity, which
is a distinctly physical phenomenon? On those who reject
such a supposition should fail the burden of finding
another.</p>

<p>Each of us sees a landscape according to our sight; to
the short-sighted (and this is a normal condition) the
landscape appears simple; trees here, there houses and
streets, men walking; but with strong glasses, as is well
known, it is possible to see many more things. Again,
the short-sighted can distinguish only the colour, veins
and serrated edge of a leaf, but if this were placed under
a microscope they would see a surface of green glittering
with light, and strewn with gold and diamonds.</p>

<p>If there are two ways of looking at a leaf, there are at
least three of looking at life; it can be seen from its
pleasant or painful side, this is to feel that we live only;
then we can grasp it with regard to the duties it imposes
on us. This is a right point of view, but it shows one
side only; or we may consider it as science represents it,
that is its moral, rational, and religious aspect combined.</p>

<p>The more we observe and the more we reflect on what
we observe, so much the more do we exercise our faculty
of understanding things; and according as this faculty
approaches or withdraws from the normal type, so it will
correspond either with the leaf seen by the naked eye or
with it as seen under the microscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[298]</span></p>


<h3 id="Ref_298a"><span class="smcap">Opposition</span></h3>

<p>There are two kinds of opposition. Very often we
come upon a true thought in a book which shocks us
because for the moment we do not recognise its truth.
We also forget that all truths can be viewed at various
angles; or we do not understand a truth because it is
expressed in a novel way.</p>

<p>A manual treating of physics will best explain the
reason of our false impression. When a ray of light is
transmitted from one medium to another of different
density, as from air to water, a change of direction is
impressed on the ray, making the straight line appear
broken; this change of direction is called <em>refraction</em>.
Cardinal Newman made a very true observation on this
subject. “If an idea is presented unexpectedly to us,” he
said, “clothed in words to which we are unaccustomed, it
is sufficient to cause us to speak of it as erroneous; this
illusion is only a simple effect of the <em>refraction of words</em>;
that is to say, that in the mind of the writer of this truth
which startles us, the idea followed a straight line, but in
our mind it became broken.”</p>

<p>The second kind of opposition is of a different nature.
It is amusing to watch two individuals who are taking
opposite sides in a heated discussion concerning some
philosopher. “What I tell you is correct; A, who is a
great scholar, says so.” “Yes, but I also know a great
scholar, B, and he says just the contrary.”</p>

<p>There seems to be a charm in controversy which few
persons can resist; they ignore what you say, and bluntly
tell you that you are in the wrong.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_298b"><span class="smcap">Abstraction, Inattention</span></h3>

<p>Not only is abstraction fatal to study, but it often plays
us sorry tricks apart from our occupations. Sometimes a<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
bright idea comes into our mind, but touching only the
surface; if by inattention or idleness we do not fix it
firmly in our memory by clothing it in suitable words, it
is a hundred to one that it is not irrevocably lost to us.
It is not more possible to arrest its flight than to fasten a
placard to the wall without nails or gum.</p>

<p>It is difficult to note with exactness the amount of
inattention which so frequently accompanies the act of
opening a serious book even with the fixed intention of
reading it.</p>

<p>I once surprised myself in a flagrant act of inattention.
I was staying with a friend, and took up Pascal’s <cite>Pensées</cite>,
which I had not read for some time. The edition was
not the same as the one I had at home. Whilst turning
over the leaves I said to myself occasionally, “How the
style has changed&mdash;this is not clear&mdash;this observation is
very shallow”; and so I went on, astonished at not being
able to admire this celebrated work as I had formerly
done. Suddenly I came upon this phrase, “Monsieur
Pascal confond tout cela.” What was my humiliation to
discover that in this edition “les Pensées de Pascal” were
followed by “les Pensées de Nicole.” I had passed from
the one to the other without noticing it. But what could
have given rise to this impression of Nicole’s? I turned
back a few pages, and read: “A book has just appeared
which is perhaps the most useful that could be placed in
the hands of princes; it is a selection of the ‘Pensées de
Pascal.’ I do not say that all are equally good ... I
find amongst them many well polished stones and fit to
adorn a great building; but the remainder appeared to be
mixed material, for which I can hardly suppose that
M. Pascal could find a use.... There are even certain
sentiments which hardly appear to be exact, and are like
scattered thoughts thrown out at random, which are
written only that they may afterwards be examined with
more care and attention. Monsieur Pascal supposes that<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
ennui comes from that which we see in ourselves&mdash;from
what we think of ourselves. That assertion is
perhaps more subtle than solid. Thousands of persons
experience ennui without thinking of themselves at all;
they feel weariness not from what they think, but because
they do not think enough.... M. Pascal confond tout
cela.” Upon my word, I felt consoled for my lapse into
inattention; to this fault I owe my acquaintance with M.
Nicole’s acute remark: “Men do not feel weariness from
what they think, but because they do not think enough.”</p>


<h3 id="Ref_300"><span class="smcap">Speech</span></h3>

<p>When the members of the human family began to use
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamor concomitans</i> which accompanied their occupations,
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamor significans</i>, these simple materials formed
the roots which indicated such and such acts, and produced
verbal and nominatival bases composed of predicative
and demonstrative elements. During the course
of ages the first became conjugated and the second were
declined. By means of adding the successive acts together,
and retaining them united in the mind, or subtracting in
several directions, our ancestors diversified the meaning
of all the primitive roots; they formed collective and
abstract nouns in their simplest form by combination.
The process never varied; thus the thought progressed
from the first root to the last concept. But the first word
ever pronounced by a human creature was a true proposition,
and our last literary chef-d’œuvre consists of a series
of propositions.</p>

<p>Descartes’ brief phrase “Cogito, ergo sum” may be
better rendered and still more briefly by one word. The
Greek word Logos, meaning word and thought combined,
had originally, as I have already remarked, the two
meanings of assembling and combining. “Cogito” = I
think, which is the short for co-agito = I assemble. The<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
act of assembling presupposes that of separating, seeing
that it is impossible to combine two or more things
without at the same time separating them from other
things. The child who is taught the first rules of
arithmetic adds and subtracts, which can only be done
by combining and separating. However little intelligence
he may have, his task does not present great difficulties
to him; and yet the most abstruse mathematical problem
consists in adding and subtracting, and the most astounding
calculations of Newton, and the most profound
mathematical speculations of Kant, are but the results
of addition and subtraction, of combining and separating.</p>

<p>In the course of time all that fills our dictionaries and
our grammars was developed and achieved, and nothing
remained for poets and philosophers to do but to add to
and deduce from the materials which they had inherited
or had themselves acquired as the result of their own
efforts; and however powerful the imagination of poets
may be, and however subtle the reasoning of philosophers,
the materials which both use to form their monuments are
exactly the same, and these are nothing but the words
derived from roots and collected in dictionaries. Most
decidedly Michael Angelo was something more than a
mason or bricklayer, but yet the basilica of St Peter’s is
made only of stones and bricks and a little cement, which,
when brought down to its final constituents, is nothing
but pulverised stone. Most decidedly one of Shakespeare’s
plays is possessed of other qualities than a mere assemblage
of the letters of the alphabet arranged in a certain order,
but the materials of which the plays are formed were
drawn from the inexhaustible supply of words accumulated
during thousands of years, and which contain no single
particle of gold or silver that is not found in the thousand
roots of our language and the 121 concepts conceived in
our minds.</p>

<p>Amongst the men who know how to think, many are<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
astonished that the so-called civilised portion of humanity
should have advanced so little, there is nothing astonishing
in this; let us consider the point, and remember that
we are only now on the morrow of the day when we
were still immature humanity, and in which the human
character, with its germs of language and of thought, only
began to be visible in us. The universe obeys the
unchangeable law which we name Divine Providence; an
irresistible law which compels matter to make certain predetermined
movements, and the mind to tend towards
perfection; man knows that he is morally free, and not
necessarily subject to animal impulses.</p>

<p>Man’s moral liberty being conceded, he uses it as he
will; at times he seeks and finds opportunities for resisting
the moral law; man, even the nominal Christian, stifles
the spirit’s higher voice and compels himself to listen to
the lower voice of the flesh. Pascal said plainly:
“According to the carnal Christian the Messiah has come
to dispense us from the necessity of loving God by providing
sacraments which act as charms apart from our
co-operation,” and our hatred and our injustice continue&mdash;under
cover of a scrupulous observance of rites&mdash;to infect
the world as well as ourselves. He spoke truly, and saw
clearly, who first said: “Every being tends to preserve its
existence.” With regard to the man of whom Pascal speaks,
this means to follow incessantly his evil practices. But,
happily, there exist other men who feel that, besides
oxygen and pleasure, they must also absorb science and
true prosperity for their well-being.</p>

<p>We read in the book of Ecclesiasticus: “In every good
work trust thine own soul” (Ecclesiasticus xxxii. 23). Yes,
let us believe in our own soul, which is the true Ego, and
it will bid us live. I am far from sharing Pascal’s opinion,
which is, that the Ego always merits contempt.</p>

<p>Science, after having noted and counted the exact
number of vibrations of all kinds which from all parts<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
affect us, at a certain point ceases to have the power to
calculate further, and recognises that beyond and above
all vibrations there exists that which can neither be
named nor counted. In my opinion that which is the
best part of science is that it knows its limitations; with
some people it is a well known experience that when they
have once grasped the fact that their inability rightly to
comprehend something they desire to know arises from
an immutable decree, they become at once imbued with a
profound quiescence, closely allied to certainty.</p>

<p>After which there is but one step left to human
reason, to forsake that reason which is but temporary,
and to lose oneself in that which has neither beginning
nor end. This last step is an act of faith. Someone,
who does not think sufficiently, calls this a leap in the
dark, but for him who accomplishes it this darkness
becomes transparent as crystal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” these persons exclaim, “and such was Kant’s
last act.” It would be more correct to say Kant ended
as he began, by an act of reason, since he drew the logical
conclusion of what he had learnt.</p>


<h3 id="Ref_303"><span class="smcap">Résumé</span></h3>

<p>The evolution of the human race will not become clear
to us unless we remember that a time existed when man
was without language and without reason.</p>

<p>During this obscure period which we name the dawn
of humanity, the material wants and their satisfaction,
comprised the whole being of man, as it does that of the
animal. With man commenced the line of individuals
leading to the higher order of social life. It is possible
that the feeling of being one of many was one of the first
to awake in man, since it was owing to the support afforded
him by his fellows that he obtained what he needed; he
was also conscious of family ties, this emotion and sentiment<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
was the cradle of all his best qualities; afterwards
would come the attractions of race; this feeling might so
dominate the individual as to cause him to forget that
he was a separate entity; then by a concurrence of circumstances
difficult to define, national feelings were
developed from the salient features of the race, and
national languages separated themselves from the central
source. The knowledge of being a portion of humanity
arrived at a much later period; he is still at this present
time a part of a feeble few, and he can be summed up in
the well-known sentence, of which the first words are,
“Homo sum.” If we consider the meaning of this classical
quotation it is very striking.</p>

<p>We often mention the pre-historic times, but we seldom
ask ourselves at what date history can have begun. With
the first heap of stones piled up by the men of a certain
tribe at the burial of a venerated chief, history commenced;
this heap became the point at which the past touched the
future, a visible link in the interminable chain of human
thought.</p>

<p>At the origin of all this mental activity we find an
inspiration&mdash;a poetical fiat. It was a historical moment&mdash;no
other similar to it has ever been, before or since&mdash;when
the first group of human creatures acclaimed with
inarticulate cries their first cavern, or the first den dug
by themselves. At a much later date when man, looking
up at the vault of heaven&mdash;his curiosity aroused&mdash;wished
to know what were the brilliant things he saw moving
high above him, was he not impelled by the feeling of
the presence of a Being hitherto unknown, and to whom
he paid unconscious homage by giving Him a name? If
the feeling had not made itself felt simultaneously with
the awakened attention caused by the appearance of the
sky, the electric spark would not have burst forth.</p>

<p>At a later date still to what can we attribute the union
of pure thought and beating hearts but to the first definite<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
perception of the Divine breath, and the conception of an
invisible yet longed for God, whose name descended from
generation to generation down to ourselves? Aristotle,
St Augustine, St Thomas Aquinas, Kant, and Max Müller,
have all described this ascension of the reason from the
first thought which contained the germ of the idea, up to
God Himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We thus arrive at a high level though starting from
low ground; we should be higher still, but that we are
retarded equally by lack of speech and of thought. As
long as we fondly imagine that in possessing a word we
are also masters of the thought attached to it, and that to
penetrate to the heart of a thought is nothing but a
linguistic exercise, or an intellectual gymnastic feat, we
shall not use the sole method with which we are supplied,
of growing morally, rationally, and religiously.</p>

<p>We form ideas of many things, but we know them only
partially and disjointedly; sciences which we have learnt
possess unity, since with grammar is connected synthesis,
and with mathematics, algebra; (this word algebra is of
Arab origin, “al djabroun,” and means the reduction of
dislocated members), is it possible that we&mdash;the creators
of these sciences&mdash;should be destined to wander around
and away from unity, and never attain it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is time to end this study; I suspect that I am not
the only one of this opinion. It is possible that amongst
my readers&mdash;if I have any&mdash;some may already have found
means of shortening it for themselves; they will perhaps
turn over the pages, read a few, and say, “How tedious
the old pedant is,” then shut the book and not open it
again.</p>

<p>This would be a pity in my opinion; they should read
a little more.</p>

<p>No philosophical work can be written without the words<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
<em>perceive</em> and <em>conceive</em> appearing very frequently in it.
The Latin language possesses the word “capio,” which
means to seize something with the hand; only convincing
facts can lead us to believe that these terms to <em>perceive</em>
and to <em>conceive</em> are derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capio</i>; thus the word
expressing the well-known physical movement of taking
something with the hand was the origin of the two words
<em>percept</em> and <em>concept</em>, without which no philosophical idea
could take shape or be developed in us.</p>

<p>The space which separates the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capio</i> from <em>percept</em>
and <em>concept</em> includes neither more nor less than the entire
evolution of man; that is, our own history.</p>

<p>That of which we think so little is in reality the
indelible sign impressed once for all on man, that which
alone distinguishes him from the animals, and which may
yet help to form in man an excellence hitherto unknown
to us; this distinguishing mark is thought and speech.</p>

<p>We are men&mdash;but has the type of the “genus homo”
been realised? Is it impossible?</p>

<p>It has been undoubtedly proved that man is free in
certain directions, and not in others; happily he is not
free not to be a man.</p>

of advising his disciples to read the Scriptures, which he so reverenced, in
the following order. He began by the Psalms, then took the books of
Solomon, then he would come to Job. After going through this course of
Old Testament history he would come to the Gospels and then to the Acts
and the Epistles. After this preparation he would turn to the Prophets,
who had foretold all that the Gospels related, and ended by allowing his
disciples to read the historical Books of the Old Testament, which might,
he thought, without such previous training, trouble and perplex them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator’s

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
